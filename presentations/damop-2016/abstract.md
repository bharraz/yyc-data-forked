## Abstract

In order to create a large electric dipole moment in a diatomic molecule, it is
generally necessary to use atoms with very different electronegativity. In the
context of bi-alkali molecules, this means combining a light alkali atom with
a heavy one. This is the reason we use NaCs in our `molecule assembler`
experiment.

However, the use of sodium atoms also poses a challenge for the trapping and
cooling of the atoms.

* The higher Doppler temperature and the lack of efficient D2 polarization
  gradient cooling increases the necessary depth of our optical dipole
  traps (`optical tweezer`).
* The lack of a convenient magic wavelength for the dipole trap creates
  a large AC stark shift on the optical transition as well as additional
  heating mechanisms.
* The light mass of the sodium, and therefore larger Lamb-Dicke parameter and
  higher recoil temperature, makes it harder to perform efficient Raman
  sideband cooling on the atom in the trap.

I will talk about the methods we use to overcome these challenges and present
the current status of trapping and cooling of single sodium atom.
