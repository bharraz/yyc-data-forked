%%% Outline

%% Goal
% New system and tool for quantum computing and quantum simulation
% Requires quantum system that is
% * Fully controllable
% * Allow entanglement
% * Scalable (to tens or hundreds)

%% System
% Many other systems in AMO
% Each approaches all have their advantages and disadvantages.
% These are the properties that we exploid and the reasons that we pick our system.
% Just like other systems they have their difficulties and that'll be the main focus of my talk.

% Molecules
% * Dipole intraction
% %% Strong, tunable, helps with achieving fast interaction
% %% while maintaining long coherence time.
% * Rich internal states (e.g. qubit state selection)

% Tweezers
% * Single site detection
% * Single site manipulation

% Two approaches (Cooling molecules vs forming molecules)
% (given our goal of combining optical tweezer with ultracold molecules)
% * Cooling molecules (show CaF picture)
% %% Difficulty on achieving lower temperature
% * Assembly (....)
% %% Difficulty on forming the molecule
% %% Allow us to use more existing technologies
% %% Transfer of coherent control

% Designed by taking advantage of the new techniques that are developed over the past decades

%% Experiment design

% * MOT
% * Tweezer trapping (metion switching) (Na + Cs single atom picture)
% * RSC in tweezer (extremely common in ion traps, also realized for atoms in tweezers before)
% * Merging
% * Forming molecules

%% Lab pictures

%% Atom preparation
% (since our goal is to transfer atom coherence to molecule coherence)
% RSC, common in ion trap, but needs tweak to work for us.
% Cs RSC, following ion trap procedure (advice from Till Roseband to sweep the pulse time)
% Na RSC, not as simple.
% High L-D parameter, high initial temperature
% The real challenge in the coupling dead zone.
% Needs higher order sideband.
% Simulation guided sequence.

%% Molecule formation

% Two step transfer scheme

% Interaction shift?

% Raman transition
% (DAMOP talk)

% Conclusion
% * Experiment aiming to create flexible array of ultracold molecules for applications like ...
% * Atomic state preparation (internal and external, and how we overcome the challenge for Na)
% * Molecular state transfer (coherence, maintaining control, all optical)
% * Next step: transfer to ground state (could be from FB molecule).

%% Goal
% But before going into the details, let's first talk about why we want to do this.

% One of the most popular paradigms in AMO,
% that is atomic, molecular and optical physics,
% is to take very simple and well understood systems,
% apply really high degree of control based on our understanding of it,
% in order to realize and study very complex dynamics
% or other interesting process that emerges from these systems.
% As probably the most well known examples in this field,
% using the simplest atoms in the world other than Hydrogen, i.e. Alkali atoms,
% by taking advantage of the interactions between these simple atoms,
% people were able to realize whole new quantum phases of matter,
% so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (or BEC),
% and even using them to simulate solid state systems
% by putting them in a lattice structure
% to further our understanding of some of the mysteries there
% such as high temperature superconductors
% that you have probably heard of one way or another.
% __()__

% But of course we aren't satisfied with only the simplest system,
% we want more, and there's good reason for that.
% You see, the neutral atomic systems, are, well, too simple.
% And what I meant is that they have relatively simple internal structures
% and they are like loners most of the time
% and really don't want to interact with other atoms.
% As you might imagine by making an analogy with social interactions,
% it's hard to convince these atoms to behave collectively
% and have interesting dynamics within the group.
% As I previously shown, not impossible, just difficult.
% What we really want is a system that is simple enough to control
% but also complex enough to do interesting stuff.
% So let's make a simple checklist for an ideal system shall we?
% __()__

% * First, as I said, it must have strong interaction, preferably a long range one.
% * Next, also mentioned before, they should have a rich internal structures.
% % These allows more interesting dynamics to occure
% % and will also be our knobs to tune the systems.
% * We would also like it to have long coherence time,
% % at least compared to the speed of the interaction,
% % so that we can do things with it before it dies.
% * And finally, we don't want to give up on our control on it.
% % If we couldn't prepare the system and ask it to do what we want it to do,
% % it's easy to see why this would makes it kinda hard
% % to use the system to do anything useful.
% __()__

% I have to say that of course we didn't come up with this list
% and we are not the only one that explore new options.
% In fact neutral atom isn't even the first system people used.
% There are many other choices of systems for example like ions and Rydberg atoms.
% Nevertheless, I believe it is still worth investigating in new systems like what we do,
% because first all of the existing systems still have their limitations
% and although I'll not claim that we fixed all those issues
% and have the best system in the world, at least not yet,
% we did fix some of the shortcoming of other experiment
% which I'll breifly talk about later.
% In the mean time, in general,
% we are also bringing in new solutions and tools to the field
% and in fact some of the techniques that we developped
% should be and are being applied to other systems.

%% System
% So now let's look at our system selection.

% I've shown this checklist with a few requirements,
% but really the most important ones are the strong interaction and full control.
% Well, the requirement of strong interaction is the main reason we chose dipole molecules.
% Compared to neutral atoms, they have much stronger and longer range interactions,
% roughly `kHz` about a micron apart which allows faster entanglement or gate operations.
% And while this might not seem like much
% compared to other strongly interacting systems I mentioned earlier
% like ions and Rydberg atoms,
% the molecules are different because they are long lived
% and the interaction between them are easily tunable.
% These somewhat unique combination of properties are very useful
% for reducing coupling with the enviroment and achieving long coherence time,
% which as you can see is part of my checklist.
% As a bonus, molecules also have a very rich internal state,
% which is the main reason for the tunability of interaction,
% and it also give us the flexibility I mentioned earlier,
% for example in the selection our qubit states.
% __()__

% The one item left now is full quantum control,
% and for that our main tool is the optical tweezer.
% This is created by focusing a light beam to a really small spot
% such that the intensity of the light is strong enough to trap a single particle,
% like, well, a tweezer.
% Since it is form by focusing light onto a small spot,
% the optics to do so very naturally gives us the resolution to see that spot
% and to detect and manipulate the single molecule within that small spot,
% hense giving us the full control we need.
% This technique has been developed in many other groups for atoms
% including Lukin group here at Harvard.
% People have demostrated sideband cooling, near deterministic loading
% and even flexible rearrangment of the tweezers.
% In our experiment, we would like to extend these capabilities from atoms to molecules
% and you'll see later in my talk how we use this to achieve quantum control on our molcules.

%% Molecules in tweezers
% So since our goal is to create ultracold molecules,
% there are basically two ways to do this.
% One approach is to first get molecule and then get ultracold,
% in another word, direct cooling of hot molecules to ultracold temperature
% without destroying or otherwise loosing the molecule in that process.
% This is a very hard problem even without loading into optical tweezer
% because of the difficulties in laser cooling,
% but there has been a lot of progress in this area.
% In fact, the Doyle group at Harvard have demostrated last year
% (actually almost two years ago) trapping ultracold CaF molecules
% in an array of optical tweezers, as you can see in this picture.
% __()__

% The other approach, which is what we use,
% is to get ultracold, and then get molecule.
% In another word, we would cool and fully control whatever make up the molecule,
% in our case atoms, before turning them into molecule coherently,
% without heating them, and in general maintaining the control we had
% on the atoms in this process.
% __()__

% Comparing the two approaches,
% the main challenge currently for the direct cooling approach
% is to cool and in general controlling the molecules in the tweezer.
% Whereas for us, what we have to do is to first establish the control on the atoms
% and then create our molecule from the atoms coherently.
% These two points will be what I'm going to focus on for the remainder of my talk

%% Experiment overview
% So first the experiment. The molecules we make is NaCs, chosen because
% a) it is a bi-alkali molecule and the alkali atoms are relatively easy to cool and control,
% and b) this molecule has a fairly strong dipole moment of 4.6 debye
% among the bi-alkalis and even among many other diatomic molecules in general.

% Since we are making molecules from atoms inside the optical tweezer,
% the obvious first step is to get the atoms in there.
% This has been done previously for Rb in other group.
% And while doing this for Cs was relatively straightforward,
% getting this working for Na had some difficulties related to the light shift of the tweezer
% that we have to overcome by switching the tweezer on and off
% as detailed in this paper that I'm not going to talk too much about.
% After figuring that out, we can now trap the atoms
% in their respective tweezers directly from the MOT
% as you can see in this picture, with about 60% loading probability.
% __()__

% We then prepare the initial state, both internal and motional, for the atoms
% using optical pumping and Raman sideband cooling to a single quantum state
% with a fairly high fidelity.
% And I'll talk about how we do this for Na in more detail later.
% __()__

% At this point the atoms are still in their own tweezers,
% which isn't very helpful for making a single molecule,
% since they are so far apart and can't see or feel each other.
% So the natural next step is to move one of the tweezers
% and merge the two atoms into the same tweezer.
% We do this in a way that minimize the heating to the two atoms
% so they remain in their motional ground states that we cooled them into.

% After the merge, the two atoms are now in the same trap
% and we proceed to measure their interaction and form the molecule from this state.
% Here you see the cover for one of our first results on making molecules,
% and it also shows what our vacuum chamber
% within which all of atoms and molecules resides.

%% Lab pictures
% ... which is a nice segway to talk about our apparatus

% this is what the experiment looks like and you can't easily see the glass cell anymore.
% Since we don't need to trap a lot of atoms and we also don't use any strong field,
% our experiment is relatively small and compact,
% at least compared to traditional bulk gas experiments.
% You can see in this picture that our whole vacuum chamber is in this region
% sourrounded by the magnetic field coil.
% From a different angle it is actually still possible to see our Na MOT
% glowing yellow in the vacuum chamber like this
% and it still get me excited every time years after seeing it.

% and our tweezer and imaging beam paths, here, as well as many others around.

%% Atom control
% So that's a rough overview of our experiment.
% And next I'll talk about how we achieve full quantum control of our atoms,
% which, if you recall, is necessary before we can do anything coherent about molecules.
% Of course, even for atoms, there are many degrees of freedoms to control
% and I don't have time to talk about every single one of them.
% So instead, I'm just going to focus on how we use Raman sideband cooling to cool Na atoms.

%% Raman sideband cooling
% So Raman sideband cooling is a technique for cooling particles,
% for example ion/atom/molecules etc., that is trapped in some potential.
% I imagine a lot of people here know about how it works
% since it's used or is considered to be used in quite a few experiment in CUA.
% So I'm going to focus more on the differences
% and unique challenges we faced in our experiment.
% I'll talk about how we overcome these challenges
% and open up this tool to ours and other systems
% and it will hopefully be interesting for people
% who already know about Raman sideband cooling.
% Nevertheless, let me give a short description of how it works
% so that we can be on the same page when I talk about the difficulties we faced.
% __()__

% So to start here is the motional levels of an atom in a harmonic potential,
% which approximate our optical tweezer.
% These discrete levels also exist for other spin states which we can drive to,
% say, with a Raman transitions.
% Now, due to the motional level, in additional to driving a "carrier" Raman transition
% at the normal resonance frequency in the middle,
% with enough resolution, we can detune from it to drive "sideband" transitions
% that changes the motional state in additional to the spin states.
% When we drive the transition on the sideband,
% we can either add, or remove motional energy from the atoms
% therefore either heat or cool the trapped atom
% and it is easy to see how this can be useful for cooling.
% Moreover, this is actually also a tool to measure the temperature of the atoms.
% As you can see here, there are fewer states to drive for cooling sideband
% than heating sideband causing a difference in their height.
% As the temperature of the atoms get lower and lower,
% the cooling sideband will be more and more surpressed
% and the assymetry between the two sideband can be used
% to infer the temperature of the atom, so-called, sideband thermometry.
% Of course, this sideband transition only remove a very limited amount of energy from the atoms
% and we have to go back to the original spin state to restart the process.
% This is done using an optical pumping step, shown here,
% which is also the step that removes the entropy, if that's your preferred picture.
% A simplified sematic of the cooling process is shown here
% which allows cooling the atom from arbitrary initial motional state
% all the way following the ladder to the ground state.

%% Lamb-Dicke parameter
% It should not be hard to see that whether this cooling cycle can work
% relies on the balance between removing motional energy from the atom
% via the "well-controlled" sideband transition,
% and the heating done in the somewhat "less-controlled" OP step.
% This ratio is determined by the so-called Lamb-Dicke parameter,
% which is defined as the ratio between the harmonic oscillator length
% and the Raman or OP wavelengths,
% and it is also proportional to the square root of the heating to cooling ratio
% that we care about.
% Because of this, one would like a small LD parameter,
% so that the heating is small compared to the cooling,
% which isn't exactly trivial to achieve for neutral atoms.
% __()__

% Of course, even for atoms in tweezers we are not the first group that did this,
% this has been done on Rb in tweezers including Misha's experiment at Harvard
% and also for us on Cs.
% However, if you look at what goes into it, the light mass of Na
% as well as the short wavelength of the transition
% causes a much bigger LD parameter, about 0.55 for Na.
% Together with a higher initial temperature for Na due to lack
% or at least difficulty of good PGC,
% we knew right off the bat that Na cooling will be hard.
% But still, the LD parameter is smaller than 0.7
% meaning we should have net cooling so we decided to give it a try.
% Well it turns out that the difficulty with RSC for Na
% is actually quite a bit more subtle and intersting then what one might naively expect.
% __()__

% First of all, although the Lamb-Dicke parameter tells us that
% we should have a net cooling per cycle on average,
% it does not capture the uncertainty of cooling process.
% As you can see in this plot, with a high Lamb-Dicke parameter,
% and for a hot initial state, similar to what we have on average for Na,
% the atom might end up in a wide varity of motional states after OP,
% which makes it much harder to control the motional state of the atom during cooling.
% This effect is also state dependent and it gets worse the higher the initial state is.
% __()__

% Second, which actually makes the first issue worse,
% is the variation of the coupling for the Raman transition.
% The sideband coupling for different motional states are different.
% This is not news for people doing sideband cooling
% and in fact we leart from Till to take this into account for our Cs RSC
% based on his old experience with RSC on ions at NIST.
% However, what's new for Na is that our Lamb-Dicke parameter
% and initial tempereture is high enough
% that our coupling strengh is not monotonic in motional level anymore
% as you can see in this plot.
% What's more, we are experiencing coupling "dead zone"s.
% And if the atoms gets here, they would get stuck
% since we would not be able to address them as efficiently just by changing the pulse times,
% as what people normally do.
% They also won't show up in our detection scan to measure the temperature
% making optimizing the cooling sequency using the experiment very challenging.
% __()__

% The solution we found to these problems
% turns out to be the large Lamb-Dicke parameter itself.
% You see, the fact that a large Lamb-Dicke parameter causes more heating
% and more spread out of states actually also means that
% the atoms have a strong coupling to higher order sidebands.
% Now if we use these higher order sideband to do the cooling
% we can significantly increase the cooling to heating ratio,
% fixing the original concern for large heating.
% It doesn't directly fix the motional state spreading out problem
% but the more efficient cooling pulse certainly helps a lot.
% __()__

% Most importantly though,
% if we add higher order sideband to this plot for the coupling strength
% we can see that the dead zone is completely gone.
% Depending on which states we want to cool,
% we can now simply pick the sideband order
% where the coupling is the largest and we'll be able to cool them down.
% Just as important, if you squint a bit
% you can just make out a smoothly varying profile of all the coupling strengths,
% which means that if we choose the right order for all the states,
% the coupling strength won't be varying too much
% and we don't even need to vary our pulse time as much.
% __()__

% With the additional complexity of the higher order sidebands,
% we switched to a computer simulation to guide our search
% so that we don't have to interpret the signal for many different sideband orders
% with oscillatory strength.
% We use it to test different experimental sequences
% and come up with a working sequence like this.
% The three different colors of Raman pulses correspond to different axis.
% We alternate between Raman and OP as well as across different axis
% as one would normally do for RSC.
% We also address the axial twice as often as each radial axis
% since it is the hardest to cool.
% However, the unique feature of our sequence is that
% we are now also cycling between two different orders of sidebands at the same time
% as you can see from the labels here.
% Simulation shows that doing this allow us to avoid
% having any atoms getting stuck in the dead zone
% and we would gradually decrease the pair of sideband orders we address
% until we reach the last order.
% When we implemented it in the experiment after calibration all the parameters,
% this is the result we got.
% We have very clear suppression of the cooling sidebands and this result,
% combining with similar measurements for the two radial axis,
% suggests that we have a 94% ground state population for Na,
% despite a high Lamb-Dicke parameter and initial temperature.

% We believe the technique we developed here is applicable to more systems,
% even for direct cooling of molecules
% where there may be similar challenges due to the the trapping force available
% and high initial temperature.

\section{Molecule creation}

%% Atom-atom interaction
% So now we have achieved full quantum control on our atoms,
% the next thing we would like is to transfer this control onto the molecules.
% But before that,
% we need to have a better understanding of the interaction between the atoms.
% The interaction will give us information about the molecular state we want to form
% and how to get there,
% and it will actually also help us to better prepare our atoms to form the molecules
% as you'll see later.
% It turns out that our tweezer is actually also a very good platform for such measurement.

%% Scattering length
% The important property that we are interested in here
% is basically the scattering length between Na and Cs.
% This is a number that describes the short range interaction
% between two particles at ultracold temperature.
% The specific properties that are related to the scattering length
% which we are interested in includes,
% * Binding energy of the least bound state,
% % which directly determines the scattering length to a good approximation,
% * Molecular potential which ultimately give rise to the bound states,
% * Both of these help us understand the molecule better for our molecule creation,
% * As well as refining predictions for FB resonances
% % % which we have another experiment working on it.

%% Interaction shift
% We measure the scattering length using interaction shift and it works like this.
% If we successfully loaded two atoms in the tweezer,
% their energy levels will be shifted due to the interaction between the them
% compared to if we only have one atom loaded.
% Now of course this cannot be directly compared to the single atom case as showned here
% since we can't really drive a transition between one atom and two atoms in the tweezer.
% So instead, we rely on the fact that this interaction is in general state dependent.
% If we drive the atoms from one spin combinantion to a different one,
% say with a Raman transition or a microwave,
% we should be able to see a shift in the resonance frequency,
% corresponding to the difference of the interaction between the initial and final spin states.
% This way of measuring the scattering length
% is similar to the experiement done in optical lattice in a MOTT insulator phase
% but the anisotropy of the trap causes some difference which you'll see shortly.
% __()__

% So we did the measurement. Here's the resonance when only Cs atom is loaded in the trap.
% Compared to this, if we measured an interaction shifted peak on the right,
% it would suggest that the final state has a lower energy
% or a more attractive interaction than the initial state,
% whereas a peak on the left would mean a more repulsive final state.
% __()__

% Now when we added the Na atom, instead of seeing one peak, we saw three peaks instead.
% Well, the center one is easy, our state preparation isn't perfect
% and in this case only 60-70% of the atoms are in the ground state
% and the hot atoms has lower density and much lower shift
% so it appears closer to the bare resonance.
% We were very confused by the other two peaks though.
% Not only do we have more than one interaction shifted peaks,
% it seems that they don't even agree on the sign of the interaction.
% __()__

% So we were puzzled by our data for a while,
% until we realized that the interaction shift that we've observed here
% is actually very similar to the axial trapping frequency.
% This means that the interaction will be strong enough to mix motional states
% and we can't simply treat it as pertubation anymore.
% In order to accurately calculate this,
% we have to go back to the full Hamiltonian shown here
% which has the term for Na, Cs and their interaction
% and we'll approximate the interaction by a contact potential
% that is proportional to the scattering length.
% (I promise this is the only slide with lots of equations by the way.)
% This is not a easy problem to solve of course
% and it actually helps to do a coordinate transformation.
% If we apply this transformation,
% which is actually the same as what one would learn in freshman classical mechanics,
% we can go from the Na and Cs coordinate to center of mass and relative coordinate.
% This is a more natural coordinate for discribing interaction,
% including molecule formation and the Hamiltonian now looks like this,
% with a center of mass part, as a simple harmonic oscillator,
% a relative part, which is the an harominic oscillator plus the interactionn,
% and a mixing part caused by the difference in the Na and Cs trapping frequency.
% __()__

% The solution the first part is very easy and it turns out that the second part,
% harminic oscillator with contact interaction, is also important enough
% that people have worked out analytic solutions for it as well,
% the only part that we need to do is the mixing term which is much more well behaved
% compared to the contact interaction and it can be solved numerically fairly easily.
% So we did it and the energy levels solved from this,
% plotted as a function of the scattering length looks like this.
% Each spin state, with its specific scattering length
% corresponds to a vertical slice on this plot
% and driving transitions between them corresponds to moving horizontally.
% Different curves corresponds to atoms in a different motional states,
% which may be center of mass or relative motion excitation or a mixture of the two.
% __()__

% It is now much easier to understand our signal.
% It turns out that in this case, our initial state has a very small scattering length
% and our final state has a large and negative one.
% The peak on the right seems to be actually the "normal" interaction shifted signal
% where the atoms remained in the motional ground state of the system after the transition.
% The signal on the left actually corresponds to the atoms acquring some motional energy
% in additional to the interaction energy,
% which puts it on the wrong side of the unshifted peak.
% __()__

% We've also measured the shift for other spin state combinations
% and this explanation works out just as good.
% Here I'm showing a case where the normal signal
% and the one with motional excitation appears on the same side
% instead of two different sides.
% __()__

% Combining this with some of our other measurements,
% we can now fit the data using the non-perturbative model
% and calculate the scattering length for all the other spin state combinations.
% __()__

% Of course we did this measurement not just to how nice it is
% to use optical tweezer to trap atoms,
% we did this measurement also to help us making the molecules.
% The numbers shown here are used, as I said earlier,
% to help us find some of the bound states and FB resonance.

% And I also want to point out that the 3,3+2,2 combination has a very strong interaction.
% This suggests that the atomic wavefunction is strongly affected by the molecular potential
% which should enhance the coupling from this state to the molecular state.
% Indeed, if we look at the radial wavefunction for these HF states,
% we'll see that the 3322 one has significantly more wavefunction component
% at short distance closer to and inside the molecular potential,
% making it the most "molecule like" atomic state.
% For this reason, we select this state to form our molecule as you'll see in the next part.
% __()__

% Another advantage for selecting this state is that
% this actually also help us preparing the atomic state itself.
% If we have another look at the interaction shift signal here,
% we said that the peak on the left corresponds to the atom acquiring some motional excitation
% whereas the right one corresponds to the atom remaining in the ground state.
% In another word, if we drive on the right peak,
% we can actually select out only the ground state atoms.
% This allow us to reduce the background of our signal
% and to be able to work even when our cooling isn't perfect,
% which improves the robustness and signal to noise of our experiment.

%% Two step transfer
% ... which basically necessitate a two step transfer process.
% The more loosely bound molecular state in the middle
% reduces the size mismatch for each steps
% and will improve overall transfer efficiency.
% And the transfer to this intermediate state is what I'll focus on in this part of the talk.
% __()__

% The "tranditional" choice of the intermediate state is a FB molecule.
% Indeed, it also works for us and **using a different apparatus
% which includes a big magnetic field coil,
% different from the one I've shown you a picture of,**
% we've recently created a single FB molecule in the optical tweezer
% and even the next step transfer to the rovibraonic ground state.
% However, this approach obviously rely on finding a good FB resonance
% and usually a large magentic field.
% __()__

% What I am going to mainly talk about today, OTOH,
% is a different approach that uses only optical transitions.
% By not relying on FB resonance, it is faster, more compact in setup,
% and most importantly, we hope it can be more generally apply to molecules
% that may not have a suitable FB resonance
% and only require laser cooling on the atoms themselves.
% __()__

% **Make sure mentioning FB molecule vs optical transfer are two different setups**

% It's worth pointing out that optical transfer **has** been done previously
% on many systems include this Rb2 Raman resonance as well as Sr2,
% and even a previous attempt from our lab.
% However, it was either done incoherently, limited by scattering,
% or, in the case of Sr2, it relies on narrow line optical transition
% which works very well but limits the generality of the result.
% So next I'll focus on how we overcome these limitations.

%% Raman scheme
% The scheme we use is actually very simple.
% We simply drive a Raman transition from the atomic state to the molecular state,
% detuned from some excited molecular state.

% Since one of the major challenges is the mismatch of the wavefunction sizes,
% it makes sense to pick molecular states that are as "big" as possible,
% in another word, ones that are closed to the threshold or even the first bound state.
% Indeed, this is what all previous attempts use
% which leads to a fairly strong Raman transition.
% But these states are also very closely spaced, and in case of the excited state,
% this makes it very hard to detune from a resonance and reduce the scattering,
% which ultimately limits the coherence, as I metioned previously.
% If we instead use an excited state that is more deeply bound.
% Even though the Raman coupling is reduced,
% we can now detune further to reduce the scattering
% without worrying about hitting another state.
% __()__

% It is certainly not obvious if the deeply bound state costs too much
% in the Raman coupling compared to the scattering reduction.
% And that's why we did a calculation to compare the two.

% From the two plots for two different excited states,
% you can easily see that the Raman Rabi frequency is indeed much higher
% for the near threshold state, compared to the deeply bound intermediate state
% at the same detuning.
% However, the scattering rate for the near threshold state stops going down very quickly
% due to the effects from other states
% whereas the scattering rate for the deeply bound states goes down much more.
% All in all, the Rabi frequency to scattering ratio,
% shown in green on the right side axis, never reaches higher than ~1.3
% for the near threshold state, whereas for the deeply bound state,
% we can get a ratio north of 50 when a larger detuning is used.

%% Experiment
% Based on the comparison, we selected the intermediate excited state
% to be the ground vibrational state (v=0) for c3Sigma,
% which we have already observed previously.
% We initially selected a initial atomic state based on the state we optical pump into.
% We weren't able to get a positive result from this initial state,
% including the resonance I showed on a previous slide.
% That's why we decided to change to the initial state with the biggest scattering length
% as measured in the interaction shift measurement I've just talked about
% to increase the coupling and used our interaction shift measurement
% to improve our state preparation.
% And for the corresponding ground molecular state,
% the binding energy was predicted as ~771 MHz by Jeremy Hutson from Durham,
% based on our interaction shift and FB measurement. (Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023108 (2020))
% __()__

% Another trick that we use is that,
% instead of adding another pair of beams to drive the Raman transition,
% we simply reuse our tweezer beam for that.
% We added AOMs to our tweezer beam path so that
% we can add a second frequency to our tweezer with controllable detuning.
% This allow us to take advantage of the high intensity of the tweezer
% to achieve a high Raman Rabi frequency so that we can do the transfer faster
% and beats other noise sources like magnetic field fluctuations.
% This also minimizes the number of beams we shine on the atom
% and reduce the total scattering rate from them.
% __()__

% Thanks to the prediction, it didn't take too long for us to find the resonance,
% which was only 1-2MHz from the prediction.

% But what's more important, and different from all previous spectrum,
% is the FWHM of 7.6 kHz.
% It is very closed to the Fourier limited linewidth for the 0.12 ms pulse time we use,
% suggesting that we are very closed to the coherent regime.
% __()__

% So next, naturally, we switched to scanning the time on resonance.
% And long and behold we see a revival in our signal,
% which is the evidence that we can drive the atoms to molecule and then back coherently.
% Shown here is one of the typical Rabi flopping we get.
% This is the first time coherent optical transfer has been done
% without using a narrow optical transition
% and we believe it can be applied to many other systems.
% __()__

% The contrast is obviously not 100%,
% but this actually correspond to more than 60% of initial ground state atom,
% here, being transfered into the molecular state.
% You can also see it in this plot of the molecule population
% as a function of the time and detuning calculated based on the experiment results.
% From the design of our transfer scheme,
% all molecules we made are in a single spin state
% with 50% or even more of them in the ground motional state.
% __()__

% We did a lot of investigation on the difference between the theory prediction
% and the experimental observation.
% We saw relatively good agreement in the parameters that affects the coherent transfer
% but we saw significant scattering rate that originate from sources
% that were not accounted for.
% This shortens the molecular lifetime which we measured here
% to be about 10 times shorter than what we expect.
% I'll save you from all the measurements that we did,
% but to summarize we have identified two different sources of extra scattering.

% The first one is from the laser, which is, in fact, already mostly taken care of
% in the data above as I'll explain shortly.
% So it turns out that in additional to the desired frequency,
% the diode laser we use to generate the tweezer and Raman beams
% also has a very broad band spectrum due to amplified spontaneous emission or ASE.
% This is something that we knew exists and everyone else also said so
% but it was surprisingly hard for us to find quantitative information about it.
% Furtunately, we found a very sensitive optical spectrum analyser,
% thanks to the Doyle group and, as I heard, Yicheng who rescued it from a trash dump.
% And it allows us to actually see this in action.
% So here you see what we got from the laser directly,
% the band here is the desired frequency,
% but in additional to that we also saw this broad spectral feature
% that spans tens of nanometers and can couple resonantly to many excited states
% and cause significant scattering.
% Furtunately, since this is a well known phenomina,
% it's actually not hard to find a solution for it.
% It turns out that people makes these 3D bragg grating to with GHz's bandwidth
% and is a perfect solution for the ASE.
% We got one from Ondax/Coherent with a line width of 30 GHz
% and as you can see in this spectrum after the filter,
% the ASE is basically completely gone.
% We can observe the effect on the Raman transition on this plot.
% On the x axis here I'm plotting the Raman Rabi frequency
% and the y axis the scattering rate we measured.
% The bottom right corner corresponds to higher Rabi frequency
% and low scattering which is good
% and the top left corner corresponds to bad transfer efficiency.
% We can see here a few points that corresponds to different tweezer powers,
% and we can clearly see that with an ASE filter added to clean up the laser,
% the points are closer to the bottom right and the transition efficiency is improved.
% But this is actually not the end of it.
% We added this filter basically right after our laser
% but we were told by the Lukin group that the fiber can cause a very similar effect as well.
% So we added a second ASE filter after the fiber and this is what we saw.
% For various reasons we were only able to take one point in this configuration
% and it's not completely tuned up, but you can clearly see that
% it is better than any of the previously measured points.
% This green point is actually the condition where we took the data that I showed you earlier
% so most of the noise should be removed already.
% However, there are still a few improvements we can do on that setup
% to ensure that we have eliminated the technical noises as my as possible.

% The second noise source is a dissociative two-photon scattering process.
% So the source I just talked about is mostly what we called background scattering
% and is insensitive to the tweezer frequency.
% On the other hand, we can also plot the tweezer frequency **dependent** part
% of the scattering after measuring it at a few different frequencies as shown here.
% We can see that this scattering fits fairly well with the tweezer power squared
% which is evidence that this can be a two photon scattering process
% and in fact it could account for almost all the scattering we saw
% after adding the two ASE filters within the error bar.
% I'll not go into too much deatails here
% but we believe a likely source of this scattering process is a Raman process
% that couples the molecular state to the motionally excited state of atoms
% in a different spin state.
% Currently we can only do a rough esitmate for this process
% and the resulting rate agrees with what we saw in the experiment
% to about a factor of 3 to 4 which proofs that it is indeed a good candidate
% depending on the value of a few parameters that we can't exactly determine yet.
% __()__

% Combining these two sources, we believe we have accounted for
% the majority of the scattering that we saw
% and both of these can be reduced either via technical improvements
% or by changing the state selections
% so we believe the transfer efficiency can be improved in the future significantly.

\section{Conclusion}
%% Conclusion
% So as conclusion, we designed and built a experiment for a new quantum platform
% based on trapping ultracold molecules in optical tweezers.
% We demonstrated the quantum control on atoms by preparing them into a single quantum state
% and use it to measure the interaction between atoms.
% After that, we’ve coherently created a single molecule in the tweezer
% using only optical transitions while maintaining the control we had on the atoms.
% We believe the efficiency can be further improved
% and we have already demostrated creation of rovibronic ground state molecule
% starting from FB molecule.

% Our experiment starts with trapped atoms in tweezers.
% People have demonstrated before us.
% It sounds simple but turns out to be anything but.

% Well, Cs is fine.
% Got without too much effort.
% But Na is not.
% A few properties.
% * Low vapor pressure (fewer atoms to load from)
% * Broad linewidth (higher Doppler temperature)
% * Low mass (move faster and higher recoil velocity/energy)
% * Small HF structure (6 line width, worse PG cooling)

% Fine just need deeper trap but run into the real issue
% * Light shift
% In order to load, need cooling in the tweezer
% However, since we need such a deep trap, light shift turns off the cooling
% Got stuck in an awkward situation where a shallow trap can keep the cooling work but
% can't hold the atom while a deeper trap can hold the atom but the atom doesn't want to come in.

% Tried a bunch of ways (turn trap around atom, two wavelengths to cancel the trap)
% before Nick came up with a genius/crazy idea that people have used on large ODT.

% See laser cooling relies on scattering that happens at a rate of tens of MHz
% OTOH, the tweezer is only needed for trap motion that happens ~ few hundred kHz.
% Means that if we switch the tweezer on and off. .....

% Tried on Cs
% Essentially made a magic trap.

% Then tried on Na, it worked.
% Na live atom.

% Raman transfer obviously need some information about the excited state
% So that's what we set out to measure first. (i.e. PA spectroscopy)

% We really have the most textbook system to do this measurement.
% We only have two atoms
% We know the initial state
% We shine some light on it, which might create some excited state molecule that
% falls down to some states that we can't see.
% We know the final state

% Full state info, improve signal-to-noise

% We start with near threshold since the lines are denser/easier to see.
% Single body - flat
% Two body - peaks
% Agreement with the theory/see new lines

% Also found deeper lines afterwards with very similar signal so I'm not showing it here.

% Now we know the excited states.
% After measuring this line, we can use add another beam in order to find
% the ground molecular state.
% With one laser parked on the PA resonance, we can scan the frequency of the other.
% When the difference between the two lasers match ... we can create a EIT and stops the
% PA process ...

% We scanned around the theoritical prediction between 200-300 MHz and indeed found the resonance.
