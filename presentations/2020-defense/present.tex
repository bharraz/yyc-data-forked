%% Goal
% But before going into the details, let's first talk about why we want to do this. __(>>2>>)__
% __(1/00:20)__

% One of the most popular paradigms in AMO,
% that is atomic, molecular and optical physics,
% is to take very simple and well understood systems,
% apply really high degree of control based on our understanding of it
% in order to realize and study very complex dynamics
% or other interesting processes that emerges from them. __(>>)__
% As probably the most well known examples in this field,
% using the simplest atoms in the world other than Hydrogen, namely Alkali atoms,
% by precisely controlling these simple atoms,
% people were able to realize whole new quantum phases of matter,
% so-called Bose-Einstein condensate,
% and even putting them in a lattice structure
% to simulate solid state systems and
% to further our understanding on some of the mysteries
% such as magnetism or high temperature superconductors.
% __(2/01:20)__

% But of course we aren't satisfied with only the simplest system
% and there're good reasons for that. __(>>)__
% The neutral atomic systems are, well, too simple.
% And more precisely what I meant is that they have relatively simple internal structures
% and they really don't want to interact with other atoms.
% As you might imagine by making an analogy with social interactions,
% it's hard to convince these atoms to behave collectively
% and have interesting dynamics within the group.
% Certainly possible as I previously shown, just difficult,
% and the achievement done with atoms really make one wonder what would be possible
% if we could have a system that is simple enough to control
% but also complex enough to make it easier to do interesting stuff.
% So, with that in mind, let's make a simple checklist for an ideal system shall we? __(>>)__
% __(3/02:25)__

% * First, as I said, it must have strong interaction and preferably a long range one. __(>>)__
% * Related to that, it should have a long coherence time,
% % at least compared to the speed of the interaction,
% % so that we can do useful things with it before it dies. __(>>)__
% * Next, also mentioned before, we would like a rich internal structure.
% % These give us more flexibility, allow more interesting dynamics to occure
% % and will also be our knobs to tune the systems. __<span style="color:red">(>>)</span>__
% * And finally, we don't want to give up on our control.
% % If we couldn't prepare the system and ask it to do exactly what we want,
% % it's easy to see why this would makes it kinda hard to use the system to do anything useful.
% __(4/03:10)__

% I have to say that of course we didn't come up with this list
% and we are not the only one that explore new options.
% In fact neutral atom isn't even the first system people used. __(>>)__
% There are many other choices for example like ions and Rydberg atoms.
% Nevertheless, I believe it is still worth investigating in new systems like what we do,
% because first, all of the existing systems still have their limitations
% and although I'll not claim that we fixed all those issues
% and have the best system in the world, at least not yet, __(>>)__
% we do have our unique properties and different trade offs
% which I'll breifly talk about later.
% In the mean time, we are also bringing in new solutions and tools to the field
% and in fact some of the new techniques I'll mention today,
% should be applicable and are being applied to many other systems.

%% System
% So now let's look at our system selection. __(>>3>>)__

% I've shown this checklist with a few requirements
% and let's start with the strong interaction. __(>>)__
% Well, this requirement is the main reason we chose dipole molecules
% as you've seen from the title.
% Compared to neutral atoms, they have much stronger and longer range interactions,
% roughly `kHz` about a micron apart allowing faster entanglement or gate operations.
% Additionally, the interacting molecules are long lived
% and the interaction between them are easily tunable.
% These somewhat unique combination of properties are very useful
% for reducing the coupling with the enviroment and achieving long coherence time,
% so that's another check. __(>>)__
% As a bonus, molecules also have rich internal states,
% which is actually the main reason for the tunability of interaction, __(>>)__
% and it give us the flexibility I mentioned earlier,
% for example in the selection of qubit states for quantum information applications.
% __(6/05:30)__

% The one item left now is full quantum control,
% and for that our main tool is the optical tweezer. __(>>)__
% This is created by focusing a light beam to a really small spot
% such that the intensity of the light is strong enough to trap a single particle,
% similar to, well, a tweezer. __(>>)__
% Since it is form by focusing light onto a small spot,
% the optics to do so very naturally gives us the resolution to see that spot
% and to detect and manipulate the single molecule trapped there,
% hense giving us the full control we need.
% This technique has been developed in many other groups for atoms
% including Lukin group here at Harvard. __(>>)__
% People have demostrated sideband cooling, near deterministic loading
% and even flexible rearrangment of the tweezers.
% In our experiment, we would like to extend these capabilities from atoms to molecules
% and you'll see later in my talk how we use this
% to achieve quantum control on the molcules we create.

%% Molecules in tweezers
% So since our goal is to create ultracold molecules,
% there are basically two ways to do this. __(>>4>>)__
% One approach is to first get molecule and then get ultracold,
% in another word, direct cooling of hot molecules to ultracold temperature
% without destroying or otherwise loosing the molecule in that process.
% This is a very hard problem even without loading into optical tweezer
% because of the difficulties in laser cooling,
% but there has been a lot of progress in this area.
% In fact, the Doyle group at Harvard have demostrated almost two years ago
% trapping ultracold CaF molecules in an array of optical tweezers,
% as you can see in this picture.
% __(8/07:35)__

% The other approach, which is what we use, __(>>)__
% is to get ultracold, and then get molecule.
% In another word, we would cool and fully control the atoms,
% before turning them into molecules coherently,
% without heating them, and in general maintaining the control we had
% on the atoms in this process.
% __(9/08:00)__

% Comparing the two approaches, __(>>)__
% the main challenge currently for the direct cooling approach
% is to cool and in general controlling the molecules in the tweezer.
% Whereas for us, __(>>)__ what we have to do is to first establish the control on the atoms
% and then create our molecules from the atoms coherently.
% These two points will be what I'm going to focus on for the remainder of my talk

% After that I'll describe our measurement of the interaction between atoms

\section{Experiment overview}
%% Experiment overview
% So first the experiment. __(>>6>>)__ The molecules we make is NaCs, chosen because
% a) it is fromed by two alkali atoms which are relatively easy to cool and control,
% and b) this molecule has a fairly strong dipole moment of 4.6 debye
% among the bi-alkalis and even many other diatomic molecules,
% which give rise to the strong interaction we need.

% Since we are making molecules from atoms inside the optical tweezer,
% the obvious first step is to get the atoms in there. __(>>7>>)__
% This has been done previously for Rb in other group.
% And while doing this for Cs was relatively straightforward,
% getting this working for Na had some difficulties related to the light shift from the tweezer
% that we have to overcome by switching the tweezer on and off.
% After figuring that out, we can now trap the atoms
% in their respective tweezers directly from the MOT
% as you can see in this picture, with about 60% loading probability.
% __(13/10:30)__

% __(>>)__ We then prepare the initial state for the atoms, both internal and motional,
% using optical pumping and Raman sideband cooling to a single quantum state
% with a fairly high fidelity.
% And I'll talk about how we do this for Na in more detail later.
% __(14/10:50)__

% At this point the atoms are still in their own tweezers,
% which isn't very helpful for making a single molecule,
% since they are so far apart and can't see or feel each other. __(>>)__
% So the natural next step is to move one of the tweezers
% and merge the two atoms into the same one.
% We do this in a way that minimize the heating to the two atoms
% so they remain in their motional ground states that we cooled them into.
% __(15/11:25)__

% __(>>)__ After the merge, the two atoms are now in the same trap
% and we proceed to measure their interaction and form the molecule from this state.
% Here are some of the results that I'll discuss in detail in the second half of my talk
% and you can also see the cover for one of our first results on making molecules.
% It shows our vacuum chamber within which all of these processes take place.

% So that's a rough overview of our experiment. __(>>9>>)__
% And next I'll talk about how we achieve full quantum control of our atoms,
% which, if you recall, is necessary before we can do anything coherent about molecules.
% Of course, even for atoms, there are quite a few degrees of freedoms to control
% and I don't have time to talk about every single one of them.
% So instead, I'm just going to focus on how we use Raman sideband cooling to cool Na atoms.

%% Raman sideband cooling
% __(>>10>>)__ So Raman sideband cooling is a technique for cooling particles,
% for example ion/atom/molecules etc., that is trapped in some potential.
% I imagine a lot of people here know something about it
% since it's used or is considered to be used in quite a few experiments in CUA.
% So I'm going to focus more on the differences
% and unique challenges we faced in our experiment.
% I'll talk about how we overcome these challenges
% and open up this tool to ours and other systems
% and it will hopefully be interesting for people
% who already know about Raman sideband cooling. __(>>)__
% Nevertheless, let me give a short description of how it works
% so that we can be on the same page when I talk about the difficulties we faced.
% __(19/14:25)__

% So to start here is the motional levels of an atom in a harmonic potential,
% which approximate our optical tweezer. __(>>)__
% These also exist for other spin states which we can drive to,
% say, with a Raman transitions.
% Now, due to the discrete motional levels,
% in additional to driving a "carrier" Raman transition
% at the normal resonance frequency __(>>)__ in the middle,
% with enough resolution, we can detune from it to drive "sideband" transitions
% that changes the motional state in additional to the spin states.
% When we drive the transition on the sideband,
% we can now either add, or remove motional energy from the atoms
% using the heating or cooling sidebands,
% and it is easy to see how this capability can be useful for cooling.
% __(20/)__

% Moreover, this is actually also a tool to measure the temperature of the atoms. __(>>)__
% As you can see here, the cooling sideband does not exist for all the levels,
% in particular not the ground level
% causing a reduction in its height compared to the heating sideband.
% As the temperature of the atoms get lower and lower
% and more atoms accumulate in the ground level, __(>>)__
% the cooling sideband will be more and more surpressed
% and this change in the assymetry between the two sidebands can be used
% to infer the temperature of the atom, so-called, sideband thermometry.
% __(21/)__

% Of course, this sideband transition only remove a very limited amount of energy from the atoms
% and we have to go back to the original spin state to restart the process.
% This is done using an optical pumping step __(>>)__
% which is also the step that removes the entropy, if that's your preferred picture.
% A simplified schematics of the whole cooling process is shown here
% which allows cooling the atom from arbitrary initial motional state
% all the way to the ground state following this ladder of transitions.

%% Lamb-Dicke parameter
% __(>>11>>)__ It should not be hard to see that whether this cooling cycle can work
% relies on the balance between removing motional energy from the atom
% via the "well-controlled" sideband transition,
% and the heating done in the somewhat "less-controlled" OP step.
% This ratio is determined by the so-called Lamb-Dicke parameter, __(>>)__
% which is defined as the ratio between the harmonic oscillator length
% and the Raman or OP wavelengths,
% and it is also proportional to the square root of the heating to cooling ratio
% that we care about.
% Because of this, one would like a small LD parameter,
% so that the heating is small compared to the cooling.
% It turns out that this isn't exactly trivial to achieve for neutral atoms.
% __(23/17:40)__

% But, of course, even for atoms in tweezers we are not the first group that did this.
% This has been done on Rb in tweezers including Misha's experiment at Harvard
% and also for us on Cs. __(>>)__
% However, if you look at what goes into it, the light mass of Na
% as well as the short wavelength of the transition
% causes a much bigger LD parameter, about 0.55 for Na.
% Together with a higher initial temperature due to the lack
% or at least difficulty of good traditional free space laser cooling,
% we knew right off the bat that Na cooling will be hard.
% But still, the LD parameter is small enough such that we should have net cooling
% so we decided to give it a try.
% Well it turns out that the difficulty with RSC for Na
% is actually quite a bit more subtle and intersting then what one might naively expect.
% __(24/18:50)__

% __(>>)__ First of all, although the Lamb-Dicke parameter tells us that
% we should have a net cooling per cycle **on average**,
% it does not capture the uncertainty of cooling process.
% As you can see in this plot, with a high Lamb-Dicke parameter,
% and for a hot initial state, similar to what we have on average for Na,
% the atom might end up in a wide varity of motional states after OP,
% between like level 15 and 25 in this case,
% which makes it much harder
% to control the motional state of the atom precisely during cooling. __(>>)__
% This effect is also motional state dependent
% and it gets worse the hotter the initial state is
% as you can see from these ever broader and flatter branching ratios.
% __(25/19:50)__

% Second, which actually makes the first issue worse,
% is the variation of the coupling for the Raman transition.
% The sideband coupling for different motional states are different.
% This is not news for people doing sideband cooling.
% In fact, this is exactly how the sideband thermometry works
% and we also learnt from Till to take this into account for our Cs RSC
% based on his previous experience with it on ions at NIST. __(>>)__
% However, what's new for Na is that our Lamb-Dicke parameter
% and initial tempereture are high enough
% that the coupling strengh we care about is not monotonic in motional level anymore
% as you can see in this plot.
% What's more, we are experiencing coupling minimums
% which I like to call "dead zone"s __(>>)__
% since if the atoms gets here, they would essentially get stuck forever
% and we would not be able to drive them out using the non-existing sideband coupling.
% Since they don't contribute to the sideband,
% they also won't show up in our detection scan to measure the temperature,
% making cooling optimization using the experiment very challenging.
% __(26/21:20)__

% The solutions we found to these problems
% turn out to be hidden in the large Lamb-Dicke parameter itself. __(>>)__
% You see, the fact that a large Lamb-Dicke parameter causes more heating
% and more spread out of states actually also means that
% we can change more motional state or reduce more energy using the Raman transition,
% in another word, using higher order sidebands.
% Now since we can cool more, the cooling to heating ratio is significantly increase,
% fixing the original concern for large heating.
% And although it doesn't directly fix the spreading out problem,
% the more efficient cooling pulse certainly helps managing it.
% __(27/22:15)__

% __(>>)__ Most importantly though,
% if we add higher order sidebands to this plot for the coupling strength
% we can see that the dead zone is completely gone.
% Depending on which states we want to cool, we can now simply pick the sideband order
% where the coupling is the largest and we'll be able to cool them down.
% Just as important, for people that are familiar with RSC,
% if you squint a bit you can just make out a smoothly varying profile
% of all the coupling strengths,
% which means that if we choose the right order for all the states,
% the coupling strength won't be varying too much
% and we don't even need to vary our pulse time as much.
% __(28/23:05)__

% With the additional complexity of the higher order sidebands,
% we switched to a computer simulation of the cooling to guide our optimization
% so that we don't have to interpret the signal for many different sideband orders
% with oscillatory strength. __(>>)__
% We use it to test different cooling sequences
% and come up with a working one like this.
% The three different colors of Raman pulses correspond to different axis
% and we interleave them with the OP pulse shown in orange below.
% And these are all standard RSC pattern.
% However, the unique feature of our sequence is that
% we are now cycling between two different orders of sidebands at the same time
% as you can see from the labels here, $m$ and $m-1$.
% Simulation shows that doing this allow us to avoid
% having any atoms getting stuck in the dead zone
% and we can gradually decrease the pair of sideband orders we address
% until we reach the last order.
% __(29/)__

% When we implemented it in the experiment after calibration,
% this is the result we got. __(>>)__
% We have very clear suppression of the cooling sidebands after cooling
% proving that most of the atoms are in the ground state.
% This result, combining with similar measurements for the two radial axis, __(>>)__
% suggests that we have a 94% ground state population for Na,
% despite a high Lamb-Dicke parameter and initial temperature.
% __(30/24:55)__

% We believe the technique we developed here is applicable to more systems,
% even for direct cooling of molecules
% where there may be similar challenges due to the the trapping force available
% and high initial temperature.

%% Interaction shift
% We measure the scattering length using interaction shift and it works like this. __(>>14>>)__
% If we successfully loaded two atoms in the tweezer,
% their energy levels will be shifted due to the interaction between them
% compared to if we only have one loaded.
% Now this cannot be directly compared to the single atom case as showned here
% since we can't really drive an atom in and out out of the tweezer
% in a controlled manner. __(>>)__
% So instead, we rely on the fact that this interaction is in general state dependent.
% If we drive the atoms from one spin combinantion to a different one,
% say with a Raman transition or a microwave,
% we should be able to see a shift in the resonance frequency,
% corresponding to the difference of the interaction energy
% between the initial and final spin states.
% This way of measuring the scattering length
% is similar to the experiement done in optical lattices in MOTT insulator phase
% but the anisotropy of the trap causes some difference which you'll see shortly.
% __(35/28:10)__

% So we did the measurement. __(>>)__
% Here's the resonance when only Cs atom is loaded in the trap.
% Compared to this, if we measured an interaction shifted peak on the right,
% it would suggest that the final state has a higher energy
% or a more repulsive interaction than the initial state,
% whereas a peak on the left would mean a more attractive final state.
% __(36/28:40)__

% Now when we added the Na atom, __(>>)__
% instead of seeing one peak, we actually saw three peaks.
% Well, the center one is easy, our state preparation isn't perfect
% and in this case only 60-70% of the atoms are in the ground state
% and the hot atoms has lower density and much lower shift
% so it appears closer to the bare resonance.
% We were very confused by the other two peaks though.
% Since not only do we have more than one interaction shifted peaks,
% it seems that they don't even agree on the sign of the interaction.
% __(37/29:25)__

% So we were puzzled by our data for a while,
% until we realized that the interaction shift that we've observed here
% is actually very similar to the axial trapping frequency.
% This means that the interaction will be strong enough to mix motional states
% and we can't simply treat it as pertubation anymore. __(>>)__
% In order to accurately calculate this,
% we have to go back to the full Hamiltonian shown here
% which has the term for Na, Cs and their interaction
% and we'll approximate the interaction by a contact potential
% that is proportional to the scattering length.
% __(38/)__

% This is not a easy problem to solve of course
% and it actually helps to do a coordinate transformation. __(>>)__
% Instead of using the Na and Cs coordinates,
% the center of mass and relative coordinates are much more natural choices
% to discribe the interaction,
% for example, like what we want to calculate here
% and also when talking about molecule formation later.
% The transformation itself is actually the same one in freshman classical mechanics
% and after that the Hamiltonian now looks like this,
% with a center of mass part, as a simple harmonic oscillator,
% a relative part, which is the a harominic oscillator plus the interaction,
% and a mixing part caused by the difference in the Na and Cs trapping frequencies.
% __(39/31:10)__

% The solution to the first part is very easy and it turns out that the second part,
% harmonic oscillator with contact interaction, is also important enough
% that people have worked out analytic solutions for it as well,
% so the only part that we need to do ourselves is the mixing term
% which is much more well behaved compared to the contact interaction
% and it can be solved numerically fairly easily.
% So we did it __(>>)__ and the energy levels,
% plotted as functions of the scattering length looks like this.
% Each spin state, with its specific scattering length
% corresponds to a vertical slice on this plot
% and driving transitions between them corresponds to moving horizontally.
% Different curves corresponds to atoms in a different motional states,
% which may have center of mass or relative motion excitation or a mixture of the two.
% __(40/32:20)__

% It is now much easier to understand our signal. __(>>)__
% It turns out that in this case, our initial state has a very small scattering length
% and our final state has a large and negative one.
% The peak on the left seems to be actually the "normal" interaction shifted signal
% where the atoms remained in the motional ground state of the system after the transition.
% The signal on the right actually corresponds to the atoms acquring some motional energy
% in additional to the interaction energy,
% which puts it on the wrong side of the unshifted peak.
% __(41/32:55)__

% We've also measured the shift for other spin state combinations
% and this explanation works out as well. __(>>)__
% Here I'm showing a case where the normal signal
% and the one with motional excitation appears on the same side
% instead of two different sides.
% __(42/33:25)__

% Combining this with some of our other measurements,
% we can now fit the data using our model
% and calculate the scattering length for the other spin state combinations __(>>)__
% and you can see the results here.
% __(43/33:40)__

% While this is cool, of course we did this measurement not just to show how nice it is
% to use optical tweezer to trap and control atoms or watch them interact,
% we did this also to help us making the molecules.
% For that, the numbers shown here are used, as I said earlier,
% to help us find some of the bound states and FB resonance.
% __(44/34:10)__

% I also want to point out that the 3,3+2,2 combination has a very strong interaction.
% This suggests that the atomic wavefunction is strongly affected by the molecular potential
% which should enhance the coupling from this state to the molecular state. __(>>)__
% Indeed, if we look at the wavefunction for these spin states,
% we'll see that the 3322 one has significantly more wavefunction component
% at short distance closer to and inside the molecular potential,
% making it the most "molecule like" atomic state.
% For this reason, we select this state to form our molecule as you'll see in the next part.
% __(45/35:00)__

% Another advantage for selecting this state is that
% this actually also help us preparing the atomic state itself. __(>>)__
% If we have another look at the interaction shift signal here,
% we said that the peak on the right corresponds to the atom acquiring some motional excitation
% whereas the left one corresponds to the atom remaining in the ground state.
% In another word, if we drive on the left peak, __(>>)__
% we can actually select out only the ground state atoms.
% This allow us to reduce the background of our signal
% and to be able to work even when our cooling isn't perfect.
% This improves the robustness and signal to noise of our experiment.

%% Size mismatch
% So just to remind you, __(>>16>>)__ here's a summary of our control of the atom,

% After we merge the two atoms into the same tweezer,
% the two atoms are about as closed to each other as they can be from the confinement.
% Nevertheless, __(>>)__ comparing to the molecule we want to make,
% it is still a few hundred times bigger.
% This massive size mismatch is really the biggest challange

%% Two step transfer
% ... which basically necessitate a two step transfer process __(>>17>>)__.
% The more loosely bound molecular state in the middle
% reduces the size mismatch for each steps
% and will improve overall transfer efficiency. __(>>)__
% The transfer to this intermediate state is what I'll focus on in this part of the talk.
% __(49/37:00)__

% The "tranditional" choice of the intermediate state is a FB molecule. __(>>)__
% Indeed, it also works for us and **using a different apparatus
% which includes a big magnetic field coil,
% different from the one I've shown you a picture of,**
% we've recently created a single FB molecule in the optical tweezer
% and even the next step transfer to the rovibraonic ground state. __(>>)__
% However, this approach obviously rely on finding a good FB resonance
% and usually a large magentic field.
% __(50/37:35)__

% What I am going to mainly talk about today, OTOH,
% is a different approach that uses only optical transitions. __(>>)__
% By not relying on FB resonance, it is faster, more compact in setup,
% and most importantly, we hope it can be more generally apply to molecules
% that may not have a suitable FB resonance
% and only require laser cooling on the atoms themselves.
% __(51/38:10)__

% It's worth pointing out that optical transfer **has** been done previously
% on many systems __(>>)__ include this Rb2 Raman resonance shown here as well as Sr2,
% and even a previous attempt from our lab. __(>>)__
% However, it was either done incoherently, limited by scattering,
% or, in the case of Sr2, it relies on narrow line optical transitio
% n which works very well but limits the generality of the result.
% So next I'll focus on how we overcome these limitations in our experiment.

%% Raman scheme
% The scheme we use is actually very simple. __(>>18>>)__
% We simply drive a Raman transition from the atomic state to the molecular state,
% detuned from some excited molecular state.
% __(53/39:10)__

% Since one of the major challenges is the mismatch of the wavefunction sizes,
% it makes sense to pick molecular states that are as "big" as possible,
% in another word, ones that are closed to the dissociation threshold
% or even the first bound state. __(>>)__
% Indeed, this is what all previous attempts use
% which leads to a fairly strong Raman transition.
% __(54/)__

% But these states are also very closely spaced, and in case of the excited state,
% have smaller detuning from other molecular state and the atomic state
% causing faster scattering,
% which ultimately limits the coherence as I metioned previously. __(>>)__
% If we instead use an excited state that is more deeply bound.
% Even though the Raman coupling is reduced,
% we can now stay further away from all the other excited states
% to surpress the scattering without worrying about hitting something else.
% __(55/40:30)__

% It is certainly not obvious if the deeply bound state costs too much
% in the Raman coupling compared to the scattering reduction.
% And that's why we did a calculation to compare the two. __(>>)__
% __(56/40:45)__

% From the top plot,
% you can easily see that the Raman Rabi frequency is indeed higher overall
% for the near threshold state shown in orange,
% compared to the deeply bound intermediate state shown in blue.
% However, if we now look at the bottom plot,
% the Rabi frequency to scattering ratio can reach much higher for the deeply bound state
% when a larger detuning is used, which corresponding to a better efficiency.
% You can also clearly see that in general,
% there are just fewer states around the blue line compared to the orange one.

%% Experiment
% Based on the comparison, we selected the blue line,
% which corresponds to using the c3Sigma ground vibrational state,
% as the intermediate excited state,
% which we have already observed previously. __(>>19>>)__
% We initially selected an atomic state based on where we optical pump into.
% We weren't able to get a positive result from this initial state,
% including the resonance I showed on a previous slide.
% That's why we decided to change to the initial state with the biggest scattering length
% as measured in the interaction shift experiment I've just talked about
% to increase the coupling and to improve our state preparation.
% For the corresponding ground molecular state,
% the binding energy was predicted as ~771 MHz by Jeremy Hutson from Durham,
% based on our interaction shift and FB resonance measurement.
% __(58/42:30)__

% Another trick that we use is that, __(>>)__
% instead of adding another pair of beams to drive the Raman transition,
% we simply reuse our tweezer beam for that.
% We added AOMs to our tweezer beam path so that
% we can add a second frequency to our tweezer with controllable detuning.
% This allow us to take advantage of the high intensity of the tweezer
% to achieve a high Raman Rabi frequency so that we can do the transfer faster
% and beats other noise sources like magnetic field fluctuations.
% This also minimizes the number of beams we shine on the atom
% and reduce the total scattering rate from them.
% __(59/43:20)__

% Thanks to the prediction, __(>>)__ it didn't take too long for us to find the resonance,
% which was only 1-2MHz off.
% __(60/43:35)__

% But what's more important, and different from all previous spectra, __(>>)__
% is the FWHM of 8.4 kHz.
% It is very closed to the Fourier limited linewidth for the 0.1 ms pulse time we use,
% suggesting that we are already in the coherent regime.
% __(61/43:55)__

% So next, naturally, we switched to scanning the time on resonance. __(>>)__
% And sure enough we see a revival in our signal,
% which is the evidence that we can drive the atoms to molecule and then back coherently.
% Shown here is one of the typical Rabi flopping we get.
% This is the first time coherent optical transfer has been done
% without using a narrow optical transition
% and we believe it can be applied to many other systems.
% __(62/44:30)__

% The contrast is obviously not 100%, __(>>)__
% but this actually correspond to more than 60% of initial ground state atom,
% here, being transfered into the molecular state.
% You can also see it in this plot of the molecule population
% as a function of the time and detuning calculated based on the experiment results. __(>>)__
% From the design of our transfer scheme,
% all molecules we made are in a single spin state
% with 50% or even more of them in the ground motional state.
% __(63/45:10)__

% We did a lot of investigation on the difference between the theory prediction
% and the experimental observation. __(>>)__
% And we concluded that the efficiency was limited by significant scattering
% from unaccounted sources.
% This shortens the molecular lifetime which we measured here
% to be about 10 times shorter than what we expect.
% I'll save you from all the measurements we did,
% but to summarize we have identified two potential sources of extra scattering.

%% ASE
% The first one is from the laser, which is, in fact, already mostly taken care of
% in the some of the data above as I'll explain shortly. __(>>20>>)__
% So it turns out that in additional to the desired frequency,
% the diode laser we use to generate the tweezer and Raman beams
% also has a very broad band spectrum due to amplified spontaneous emission or ASE.
% This is something that we knew before and everyone else we asked also know about it
% but it was surprisingly hard for us to find quantitative information about it.
% __(65/)__

% Furtunately, we found a very sensitive optical spectrum analyser,
% thanks to the Doyle group and, as legend has it,
% Yicheng who basically rescued it from a trash dump.
% This allows us to actually see the ASE in action.
% So here you see what we got from the laser directly,
% the band here is the desired frequency,
% but in additional to that we also saw this broad spectral feature
% that spans tens of nanometers and can couple resonantly to many excited states
% and cause significant scattering.
% __(66/)__

% Furtunately though, since this is a well known problem,
% it was actually easer to find a solution than to measure it. __(>>)__
% It turns out that people makes these 3D Bragg grating with GHz's bandwidth
% and it's a perfect solution to clean up the ASE.
% We got one from Ondax/Coherent with a line width of about 30 GHz
% and __(>>)__ as you can see in this spectrum after the filter,
% the ASE is basically completely gone.
% We move on to test it with our molecule __(>>)__ and the result is shown on this plot.
% __(67/)__

% On the x axis here I'm plotting the Raman Rabi frequency
% and the y axis the scattering rate we measured.
% The bottom right corner corresponds to higher Rabi frequency
% and low scattering which is good
% and the top left corner corresponds to bad transfer efficiency.
% A few points for different tweezer power and filter contiditions are shown,
% and we can clearly see that with a filter added to clean up the laser,
% the points are closer to the bottom right and the transition efficiency is improved.
% __(68/)__

% But this is actually not the end of it. __(>>)__
% We added this filter basically right after our laser
% as shown in this very simplified schematic
% but we were told by the Lukin group that the fiber can cause a very similar effect as well.
% So we added a second filter after the fiber roughly like this __(>>)__
% and we can see the new result here.
% __(69/)__

% For various reasons we were only able to take one point in this configuration
% and it's not completely tuned up either.
% Still you can clearly see that the new point is better
% than any of the previously measured ones.
% This green point is actually the condition where we took the Rabi oscillation
% that I showed you earlier so most of the noise should be removed already.
% However, there are still a few related improvements we can do on that setup
% to ensure that we have eliminated the technical noises as much as possible.

%% Two-Photon
% The second potential loss mechanism is a two-photon scattering process. __(>>21>>)__
% So the source I just talked about is mostly what we called background scattering
% and is not very sensitive to the tweezer frequency.
% On the other hand, we can also plot the tweezer frequency **dependent** part
% of the scattering after measuring it at a few different frequencies as shown here.
% We can see that this scattering fits slightly better to the tweezer power squared
% which suggests that this could be a two photon scattering process
% and in that case it could account for almost all the scattering
% with the two filters setup. __(>>)__
% One likely source of this scattering is a Raman process
% that couples the molecular state to the motionally excited state of atoms
% in a different spin state, shown in green.
% Currently we can only do a rough esitmate for this process
% and the result confirms that this is indeed a fine candidate
% depending on the value of a few parameters that we can't exactly determine yet.
% __(71/50:55)__

% Combining these two sources, we believe we have accounted for
% the majority of the scattering that we saw
% and both of these can be reduced either via technical improvements
% or by changing the state selections
% so we should be able to increate the transfer efficiency significantly in the future.

\section{Conclusion}
%% Conclusion
% So as conclusion, __(>>22>>)__ we designed and built an experiment for a new quantum platform
% based on trapping ultracold molecules in optical tweezers. __(>>)__
% We demonstrated the quantum control on atoms
% by preparing them into a single quantum state __(>>)__
% and use it to measure the interaction between atoms. __(>>)__
% After that, we coherently created a single molecule in the tweezer
% using only optical transitions while maintaining the control we had.
% We believe the efficiency can be further improved. __(>>)__
% Looking ahead, the molecules needs to be transfered to the rovibronic ground state
% to turn on the strong interaction
% and we have actually just demostrated it starting from FB molecule in a separate setup.

%% Backup slides

% Our experiment starts with trapped atoms in tweezers.
% People have demonstrated before us.
% It sounds simple but turns out to be anything but.

% Well, Cs is fine.
% Got without too much effort.
% But Na is not.
% A few properties.
% * Low vapor pressure (fewer atoms to load from)
% * Broad linewidth (higher Doppler temperature)
% * Low mass (move faster and higher recoil velocity/energy)
% * Small HF structure (6 line width, worse PG cooling)

% Fine just need deeper trap but run into the real issue
% * Light shift
% In order to load, need cooling in the tweezer
% However, since we need such a deep trap, light shift turns off the cooling
% Got stuck in an awkward situation where a shallow trap can keep the cooling work but
% can't hold the atom while a deeper trap can hold the atom but the atom doesn't want to come in.

% Tried a bunch of ways (turn trap around atom, two wavelengths to cancel the trap)
% before Nick came up with a genius/crazy idea that people have used on large ODT.

% See laser cooling relies on scattering that happens at a rate of tens of MHz
% OTOH, the tweezer is only needed for trap motion that happens ~ few hundred kHz.
% Means that if we switch the tweezer on and off. .....

% Tried on Cs
% Essentially made a magic trap.

% Then tried on Na, it worked.
% Na live atom.

% Raman transfer obviously need some information about the excited state
% So that's what we set out to measure first. (i.e. PA spectroscopy)

% We really have the most textbook system to do this measurement.
% We only have two atoms
% We know the initial state
% We shine some light on it, which might create some excited state molecule that
% falls down to some states that we can't see.
% We know the final state

% Full state info, improve signal-to-noise

% We start with near threshold since the lines are denser/easier to see.
% Single body - flat
% Two body - peaks
% Agreement with the theory/see new lines

% Also found deeper lines afterwards with very similar signal so I'm not showing it here.

% Now we know the excited states.
% After measuring this line, we can use add another beam in order to find
% the ground molecular state.
% With one laser parked on the PA resonance, we can scan the frequency of the other.
% When the difference between the two lasers match ... we can create a EIT and stops the
% PA process ...

% We scanned around the theoritical prediction between 200-300 MHz and indeed found the resonance.
