# Research accomplished in the past year

1. Implement and optmize Raman sideband cooling for Sodium

    * Observe and characterize Raman sideband in all three axis
    * Obtain a better understanding of the cooling process by calculating or measuring most
      of the imperfections during the cooling
    * Optimize the cooling sequence and characterize the cooling results.

2. Observe NaCs photo-association spectrum

    * Merge Na and Cs trap
    * Reduce spin exchange loss between Na and Cs atoms by preparing the initial hyperfine states
    * Measure NaCs electronic excited state energy levels

# Experiment timeline

* 2017 - early 2018

    Create loosely bound NaCs molecule

* 2018

    Create singlet ground state NaCs molecule

Goals of the experiment:

* Create multiple NaCs singlet ground state molecules

* Demonstrate interaction and quantum gates
