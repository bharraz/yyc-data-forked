# Research accomplished in the past year

1. Raman sideband cooling for Sodium.

    * Observing and characterizing all Raman sideband
    * Understanding of the cooling process
    * Optimizing and characterizing cooling sequence

2. NaCs photo-association spectrum

    * Merging Na and Cs trap
    * Reducing spin exchange loss between Na and Cs atoms
    * Measure NaCs electronic excited state energy levels

# Timeline

* 2017 - early 2018

    Loosely bound NaCs molecule

* 2018

    Ground state NaCs molecule

Goals:

* Create multiple NaCs singlet ground state molecules.

* Demonstrate interaction and quantum gates.
