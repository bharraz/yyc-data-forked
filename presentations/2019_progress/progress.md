# Research accomplished in the past year

1. Working on implementing Raman transfer to bound NaCs electronic ground state

     * Measured PA resonance for deeply bound excited electronic state
     * Observed EIT resonance
     * Observed Raman resonance

2. Better understanding of interaction from interaction shift and PA spectroscopy

# Experiment timeline

* 2019 - 2020

     * Identify and avoid the cause of loss in the optical transfer to loosely bound molecule
     * Create loosely bound NaCs molecule
     * Create singlet ground state NaCs molecule

Goals of the experiment:

* Create multiple NaCs singlet ground state molecules

* Demonstrate interaction and quantum gates
