# Research accomplished in the past year

1. Working on implementing Raman transfer to bound NaCs electronic ground state

    * Measured PA resonance for deeply bound excited electronic state
    * Observed EIT resonance
    * Observed Raman resonance

2. Experiment with multiple tweezers

    * Measured the effect of trap polarization and AOM longitudinal (Z) misalignment
    * Improve stability of tweezer power

3. Working on microwave transfer to bound NaCs electrounic ground state

    * Measured atomic microwave transition

4. Improved atom temperature

    * Improved Na Raman sideband cooling performance (Larger detuning and better pulse shaping)
    * Improve merge temperature (Axial alignment and better trap intensity stability)

# Experiment timeline
