\title{Building Single Molecules from Single Atoms}
\date{Jul. 2020}
\author{Yichao Yu}
\institute{Ni Group/Harvard}

%%% Outline

%% Goal
% New system and tool for quantum computing and quantum simulation
% Requires quantum system that is
% * Fully controllable
% * Allow entanglement
% * Scalable (to tens or hundreds)

%% System
% Many other systems in AMO
% Each approaches all have their advantages and disadvantages.
% These are the properties that we exploid and the reasons that we pick our system.
% Just like other systems they have their difficulties and that'll be the main focus of my talk.

% Molecules
% * Dipole intraction
% %% Strong, tunable, helps with achieving fast interaction
% %% while maintaining long coherence time.
% * Rich internal states (e.g. qubit state selection)

% Tweezers
% * Single site detection
% * Single site manipulation

% Two approaches (Cooling molecules vs forming molecules)
% (given our goal of combining optical tweezer with ultracold molecules)
% * Cooling molecules (show CaF picture)
% %% Difficulty on achieving lower temperature
% * Assembly (....)
% %% Difficulty on forming the molecule
% %% Allow us to use more existing technologies
% %% Transfer of coherent control

% Designed by taking advantage of the new techniques that are developed over the past decades

%% Experiment design

% * MOT
% * Tweezer trapping (metion switching) (Na + Cs single atom picture)
% * RSC in tweezer (extremely common in ion traps, also realized for atoms in tweezers before)
% * Merging
% * Forming molecules

%% Lab pictures

%% Atom preparation
% (since our goal is to transfer atom coherence to molecule coherence)
% RSC, common in ion trap, but needs tweak to work for us.
% Cs RSC, following ion trap procedure (advice from Till Roseband to sweep the pulse time)
% Na RSC, not as simple.
% High L-D parameter, high initial temperature
% The real challenge in the coupling dead zone.
% Needs higher order sideband.
% Simulation guided sequence.

%% Molecule formation

% Two step transfer scheme

% Interaction shift?

% Raman transition
% (DAMOP talk)

% Conclusion
% * Experiment aiming to create flexible array of ultracold molecules for applications like ...
% * Atomic state preparation (internal and external, and how we overcome the challenge for Na)
% * Molecular state transfer (coherence, maintaining control, all optical)
% * Next step: transfer to ground state (could be from FB molecule).

%% Goal
% The long term goal of our experiment is to create a new system
% for quantum computing and quantum simulation, as well as, in general,
% adding new tools to the so-called AMO toolbox for potentially other applications.
% These applications require our system to be fully controllable to single particle level
% as well as allowing creating entanglement between the particles.

% There are many good candidates, and even just in AMO there are
% neutral atoms, ions, Rydbergs etc, so why are we adding yet another one to the list.
% Well, first of all, broadly speaking, you'll never know what you'll get unless you try it.
% There are often pleasant supprises, even from the difficulties one face in the experiment,
% as you'll see later.
% (And this really applies to many other things including some big discovery as well.)
% More concretely, although some approaches have got closer to the goal then others,
% no one have actually got there yet and there are still big challeges for all of them.
% So the door is still open, and although I'm definately not going to claim we have the
% best system in the world, I do believe we are bringing in new ideas and
% new solutions for some of the issues in other systems.

%% System
% Hopefully it make sense now that despite all the achievements in other approaches,
% it is still interesting to study new systems, if it has new desired properties.
% So now let's look at our system.

% The two properties that I've emphasized on initially are full quantum control and
% entanglement. And let's first talk about entanglement.
% Well, entangling different particles essentially means interaction.
% And this is the main reason we chose dipole molecules.
% Compared to neutral atoms, they have much stronger and longer range interactions,
% roughly `kHz` about a micron apart. This might not seem like much compared to other strongly
% interacting systems like ions and Rydberg atoms, the interacting molecular
% states are long lived and easily tunable, which is useful for reducing coupling with
% the enviroment and achieve long coherence time.
% Molecules also have a very rich internal state, which is the main reason for the tunability,
% but it also give us a lot of freedom in selection our qubit states, for example.

% The other important property we are aiming for is full quantum control,
% and for that our main tool is the optical tweezer.
% Since the tweezer is generally form through a high-NA objective,
% it very naturally gives us the resolution for single site detection and even manipulation
% of the molecules. This technique has been developped in many other groups for atoms including
% here in Cindy's lab, demostrating sideband cooling, near deterministic loading
% and rearranging.
% So we would like to extend these capability from atoms to molecules and
% you'll see later in my talk how we use this to achieve quantum control on our molcules.

%% Molecules in tweezers
% So since our goal is to create ultracold molecules, there are basically two approaches.
% One approach is to first get molecule and then get ultracold, in another word, direct cooling
% of hot molecules to ultracold temperature without destroying or otherwise loosing the molecule.
% This is a very hard problem because of the difficulties in laser cooling, but there
% has been a lot of progress in this area, including an experiment here at JILA in Jun's group.
% In fact, the Doyle group at Harvard have recently demostrated ultracold CaF molecules
% in an array of optical tweezers, as you can see in this picture.

% The other approach, which is what we use, is to get ultracold, and then get molecule.
% In another word, we would cool and fully control whatever make up the molecule,
% in our case atoms, before turning them into molecule coherently,
% without heating them, and in general maintaining the control we had on them in this process.

% Comparing the two approaches, the main challenge currently for the direct cooling approach
% is to cool and in general controlling the molecules in the tweezer. Whereas for us,
% our challenge is to first obtaining the control on the atom, and the coherence creation of the
% molecules. These two main challenges will be what I'm going to focus on
% for the remainder of my talk.

\section{Experiment overview}
% So first the experiment.
% The molecules we make is NaCs, chosen because
% a) the alkali atoms are relatively easy to cool and control, and
% b) this molecule has a fairly strong dipole moment of 4.6 debye among the bi-alkalis.

% Since we are making molecules from atoms inside the optical tweezer,
% the obvious first step is to get the atoms in there.
% We trap the atoms in their respective tweezers directly from the MOT as you can see
% in this picture, with abouot 60% loading probability.

% We then prepare the initial state, both internal and motional,
% for the atoms using optical pumping and Raman sideband cooling to a single state
% with a fairly high fidelity, which I'll talk about later.

% At this point the atoms are still in their own tweezers,
% which isn't very helpful for making a single molecule.
% So the natural next step is to move one of the tweezers and
% merge the two atoms into the same tweezer.
% We do this in a way that minimize the heating to the two atoms so they remain in their
% motional ground states that we cooled them into.

% After the merge, the two atoms are now in the same trap and we proceed to form the molecule from this state.
\begin{frame}{Experiment overview}
\end{frame}

%% Lab pictures
% In real world this experiment looks like this.
% Since we don't need to trap a lot of atoms and we also don't use any rediculously strong field,
% our experiment is relatively small and compact.
% You can see in this picture our whole vacuum chamber with the optics surounding it
% for cooling, detection, etc.
% It might not look too impressive compared to an ion experiment,
% I know some of those are real neat, but it's already very clean compared to
% some other neutral atom experiments that I've worked on before...

%% Atom control
% So next I'll talk about our state control of the atom.
% Of course, even for atoms, there are many degrees of freedoms to control
% and I don't have time to talk about every single one of them.
% So instead, I'm just going to focus on how we use Raman sideband cooling to cool Na atoms.
\section{Atom state control}
\subsection{Raman sideband cooling of Na atoms}
\begin{frame}{Outline}
  \tableofcontents[currentsection,currentsubsection]
\end{frame}

%% Raman sideband cooling
% I imagine most people here are very familiar with Raman sideband cooling.
% In fact, I feel like it is used so common in ion experiments that people stops
% talking about it. So I believe I don't have to talk too much about how it works in general.
% Instead, I'll focus on the difference in our experiment and the new challenges we face.
% And I'll talk about how we overcome these challenges and open up this tool to
% ours and other future experiments where Raman sideband cooling were previously thought
% to be very hard or impossible.

% Before that, let me just very quickly go through how Raman sideband cooling works
% even though you probably know already.
% So here is the motional levels of an atom in a harmonic potential, which approximate our
% optical tweezer. These levels exists for all the ground HF states so here is it for a different
% one. Now, we can drive between different ground HF states with a Raman transitions.
% But due to the motional levels, in additional to driving a "carrier" Raman transition,
% we can also drive "sideband" transitions that changes the motional state
% in additional to the HF states.
% Now, if we drive such a transition that removes a quanta of motional energy from the
% atom, followed by an optical pumping step that removes the emtropy and
% resets the HF state of the atom,
% we would have overall reduced the motional energy of the atom, therefore cooling it.
\begin{frame}{Raman sideband cooling}
\end{frame}

% Lamb-Dicke parameter
% It is not too hard to see that whether this cooling cycle can work relies on the balance
% between removing motional energy from the atom via the sideband transition,
% and the heating done in the OP step. This ratio is determined by the so-called Lamb-Dicke
% parameter, which is defined as the ratio between the harmonic oscillator length
% and the Raman or OP wavelengths, and it is also proportional to the square root of the
% recoil energy and the trapping frequency, which is exactly what we want.
% Because of this, one would like a small LD parameter so that the heating is small
% compared to the cooling. This is OK for Cs and also for Rb which was demostrated
% in other groups before, but the light mass of Na as well as the short wavelength
% of the D lines causes a much bigger LD parameter.
% Together with a higher initial temperature for Na due to lack of good PGC,
% we knew right off the bat that Na cooling will be hard.
% But still, the LD parameter is smaller than one so we decided to give it a try
% and it turns out that the difficulty with RSC for Na is more subtle then what one
% might naively expect.

% First of all, although the Lamb-Dicke parameter tells us that we should have
% a net cooling per cycle on average, it does not capture the uncertainty of cooling process
% as you can see in this plot, with a high Lamb-Dicke parameter, the atom might end up
% in a wide varity of states and it is worse the high the initial state is.
% Second, which is makes the first issue worse, is the variation of the coupling.
% The sideband coupling for different motional states are different. This is not news
% for people doing sideband cooling and in fact we leart from Till Roseband to take this
% into account for our Cs RSC based on his old experience with RSC on ions right here at NIST.
% However, what's new for Na is that our Lamb-Dicke parameter and initial tempereture is high
% enough that we are experiencing coupling "dead zone"s.
% If the atoms gets here, we would not be able to address them as efficiently
% (and can't be easily fixed by changing the pulse times) and they also won't show up
% in our detection making optimization very hard.

% The solution we found to these problem turns out to be the large Lamb-Dicke parameter itself.
% You see, the fact that a large Lamb-Dicke parameter cause more heating
% and more spread out of states actually also means that the atoms has a strong coupling
% to higher order sideband. Now if we use these higher order sideband to do the cooling
% we can significantly increase the cooling to heating ratio, fixing the original concern
% for RSC. It doesn't directly fix the spreading out problem but it does give us
% more ways to deal with it.
% Most importantly though, if we add higher order sideband to this plot for the coupling strength
% we can see that the dead zone is completely gone. Depending on which states we want to cool,
% we can now simply pick the sideband order where the coupling is the largest
% and we'll be able to cool them down.

% With the additional complexity of the higher orders, we switched to a computer simulation
% to guide our search so that we don't have to interpret the signal for
% many different sideband orders. We use it to test different experimental sequences
% and come up with this sequence that always address two neighboring orders of sideband.
% When we implemented it in the experiment after calibration all the parameters, this
% is the result we got. We have very clear suppression of the cooling sideband
% and this result suggests that we have a 94% ground state population for Na,
% despite a high Lamb-Dicke parameter and initial temperature.

\section{Optical molecule creation}
% So now we've overcame one of the last and biggest challenge we had
% on preparing the initial state for the atom. I'll now talk about how we
% make the molecules while maintaining this control.
\begin{frame}{Outline}
  \tableofcontents[currentsection]
\end{frame}

%% Size mismatch/optical transfer
% So here's a summary of our control of the atom.
% After we merge the two atoms into the same tweezer,
% the two atoms are about as closed to each other as they can be
% from the confinement. However, in the molecule we want to make,
% the two atoms are still hundreds times closer.
% This massive size mismatch is really the biggest challange for creating molecules coherently.

%% Size mismatch
% ... which basically necessitate a two step transfer process.
% The more loosely bound intermediate molecular state reduces
% the size mismatch and will improve overall efficiency.
% In today's talk, I'll mostly focus on the first step starting from the atomic state
% (as you might have guessed from the title of my talk).

% The "tranditional" choice of the intermediate state is a FB molecule.
% Indeed, it also works for us and we've recently created a single FB
% molecule in the optical tweezer that is suitable for doing the next step transfer from.
% However, this approach obviously rely on finding a good FB resonance and usually
% a large magentic field.

% What I am going to talk about today, OTOH, is a different approach that uses only
% optical transitions. By not relying on FB resonance, it is faster, more compact,
% and most importantly, we hope it can be more generally apply to
% molecules that may not have a suitable FB resonance.

% It's worth pointing out that optical transfer **has** been done previously
% on many systems include this Rb2 Raman resonance and even a previous attempt from our lab.
% However, it was either done incoherently, or it relies on narrow line transition
% which limits the generality of the result.
% So next I'll talk about how we overcome these limitations.

%% Raman scheme
% The scheme we use is actually very simple.
% We simply drive a Raman transition from the atomic state to the molecular
% state, detuned from some excited molecular state.

% Since one of the major challenges is the mismatch of the wavefunction size,
% it makes sense to pick a molecular state that is as "big" as possible,
% i.e. the molecular states that are closed to the threshold or even the first bound state.
% Indeed, this is what all previous attempts use which leads to a fairly strong Raman transition.
% However, these states are very closely spaced, and in case of the excited state, this makes
% it hard to detune and reduce the scattering, which ultimately limits the coherence,
% as I metioned previously.
% If we instead use an excited state that is more deeply bound.
% Even though the Raman coupling, we can now detune further to reduce the scattering
% without worrying about hitting another state.

% It may not be obvious if the deeply bound state costs too much in the Raman coupling
% compared to the scattering reduction. That's why we did a calculation to compare the two.

% From the two plots for two different excited states,
% you can easily see that the Rabi frequency to scattering ratio, shown in green
% on the right side axis, never reaches higher than ~1.3 for the near threshold state
% whereas for the deeply bound state we can get a ratio north of 50 when a larger
% detuning is used.
