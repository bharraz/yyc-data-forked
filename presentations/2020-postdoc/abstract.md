Ultracold polar molecules have long-range, anisotropic, and tunable interactions providing a versatile platform for studying quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum simulation.
Optical tweezers allow us to trap atoms and molecules in flexible configurations and fully control their quantum states. I will present results on coherent optical creation of single NaCs molecules in optical tweezers with control of the internal and external quantum state.
I'll discuss the method we use to create the molecule and demonstrate the control of the quantum states for the atoms and molecules in the optical tweezer.
