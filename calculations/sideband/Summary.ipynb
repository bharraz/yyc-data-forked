    "3. High initial $\\bar n$\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use the initial average energy closed to what measured in the experiment.\n",
    "    As expected, this is mainly an issue for initial coolng but doesn't affect\n",

    "### Imperfections not included\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coupling between axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The new vertical beam should help reducing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Off-resonance coupling of Raman beam\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pulse shaping should reduce this in the experiment for pulse cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Spontaneous emission from the Raman beam\n",
    "\n",
    "    We should be able to reduce this by increasing the detuning and\n",
    "    optimizing the Raman beams polarizations. This is harder to implement\n",
    "    and also need more input from the experiment."

    "       \"carrier Rabi rate\" can change as the atoms cools down.\n",

    "       of the Rabi rate using the carrier might be off (since it was done before\n",

    "       This is the amplitude (or the corresponding $\\pi$ time) where cooling on this\n",
    "       order is the most efficient and seems to agree with the simulation.\n",
