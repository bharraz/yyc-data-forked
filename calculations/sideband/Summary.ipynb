    "    The F2 optical pumping is assumed to address the dark state (`2, -2` state)\n",

    "    This is mainly a disadvantage for the OP.\n",

    "3. High initial $\\bar n$\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use the initial average energy closed to what measured in the experiment.\n",

    "### Imperfections not included\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coupling between axis.\n",

    "    The new vertical beam should help reducing this.\n",

    "2. Off-resonance coupling of Raman beam\n",

    "3. Spontaneous emission from the Raman beam\n",
    "\n",
    "    We should be able to reduce this by increasing the detuning and\n",
    "    optimizing the Raman beams polarizations. This is harder to implement\n",

    "    ![Radial](../sideband_strength/imgs/coupling_0.35_0-2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A few important features of the coupling strength variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The matrix elements for most sideband orders goes to (near) zero\n",
    "       for certain states within the range we care about.\n",
    "       And even for the high orders where the matrix element does not go to zero\n",
    "       yet, they all deviate significantly from first order low $n$ power expansion.\n",
    "       This is why we cannot use the sideband asymmetric to measure the average $n$\n",
    "       when the atoms are hot.\n",
    "\n",
    "       Note that this also includes the 0th order, meaning that the\n",
    "       \"carrier Rabi rate\" can change as the atoms cools down.\n",
    "       We've observed this in the experiment and it mainly means that the calibration\n",
    "       of the Rabi rate using the carrier might be off (since it was done before\n",
    "       observing this effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. All of the orders have at least one maximum.\n",
    "       This is the amplitude (or the corresponding $\\pi$ time) where cooling on this\n",
    "       order is the most efficient and seems to agree with the simulation.\n",
    "       For a relatively hot and thermal distribution,\n",
    "       this is also the amplitude with the largest number of the atoms.\n",
    "       When driving a Raman transition, this roughly corresponds to the $\\pi$ time\n",
    "       of the first oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Even though for low $n$ the matrix element decays very quickly\n",
    "       as $\\Delta n$ increases, the maximum of the matrix element decays much more\n",
    "       slowly. This makes it very efficient to use a pulse time corresponding\n",
    "       to the maximum matrix element to cool on each sideband order.\n",
    "       Due to the slow variation of matrix element around this maximum, this can\n",
    "       also cover a relatively wide range of $n$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "       This effectively means that we can assign each sideband orders with a\n",
    "       range of $n$ and vise versa. It also makes it unnecessary to sweep the\n",
