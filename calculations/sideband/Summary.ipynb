    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Coupling between axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The new vertical beam should help reducing this.\n",

    "2. Off-resonance coupling of Raman beam\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pulse shaping should reduce this in the experiment for pulse cooling.\n",

    "3. Spontaneous emission from the Raman beam\n",
    "\n",
    "    We should be able to reduce this by increasing the detuning and\n",
    "    optimizing the Raman beams polarizations. This is harder to implement\n",
    "    and also need more input from the experiment."
