    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiemental effort of loading single Na atom is proven to be quite challenging. Compare to other atoms that people have successfully trapped in a tweezer (Cs, Rb), we have identified many possible reasons including (not necessarily independent)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller exited state hyperfine structure\n",
    "* Not as efficient sub-Doppler cooling\n",
    "* No accessible magic wavelength for D2\n",
    "* Stochastic heating\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the characteristic of out system (Lamb-Dicke parameter $\\eta\\approx1$), it is very hard to analytically study these effects. On the other hand, since the system is very simple, a single atom with very few degrees of freedom, it is possible to do a precise numerical study of it."

    "However, doing a deterministic calculation of the master equation requires the whole density matrix and many high dimensional matrix operations which is not very efficient. Instead, we use the [quantum jump method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_jump_method) (or Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method) to estimate the density matrix (and any measurable quantity derived from it) by evolving a wave function probabilistically.\n",

In each time step of the simulation, we probabilistically choose either to evolve the wave function with the quantum jump or the Hamiltonian. The probability for doing each jump is determined by the expectation value of the jump operator $p_m=\\langle C_m^\\dagger C_m \\rangle$.\n",
