# Sideband strength

Calculating the strength of the sideband.

* Calculate the strength (matrix element) for a pair of state
  (with a certain Lamb Dicke parameter).

* For a thermal distribution.

    This can tell us what signal we expect from a 1d trap.

* (Possibly) for a 2d or 3d trap to check if we can drive multiple sideband
  at the same time and see difference frequency.
