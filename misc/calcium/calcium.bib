  abstract = {Isotope shifts and hyperfine structure splittings of the CaI resonance line (4⁢{$s$}2⁢1{$S$}0 -4⁢{$s$}⁢4⁢{$p$}⁢1{$P$}1, {$\lambda$} =422.7 nm) have been measured for all calcium isotopes between 40Ca and 48Ca, including the short-lived isotope 47Ca ({$T$}12 =4.54 d). Resonance fluorescence was observed in a well-collimated atomic beam of calcium excited by a narrow band tunable continuous-wave dye laser. Combining the result with muonic x-ray data for the stable isotopes, accurate values for the changes of mean square charge radii of the Ca nuclei are obtained, in addition to information on electromagnetic moments from the measured hyperfine structure constants. The influence of ground state correlations (represented by quadrupole and octupole mean square deformations) on the observed peculiar variation of the Ca charge radii is discussed as well as the relation to the droplet model and to a mixed ({$f$}72){$n$} model.},

By applying a voltage to electrodes in the calcium vapour, Stark shifts were measured for levels belonging to the 4snf1F30 and 4s(n+1)d1D2 series in a region where the series cross. Diagonalisation of the energy matrix for interacting states with hydrogenic dipole matrix elements gave theoretical Stark shifts in reasonable agreement with those measured.

  abstract = {We apply the chirped-pulse millimeter-wave (CPmmW) technique to transitions between Rydberg states in calcium atoms. The unique feature of Rydberg--Rydberg transitions is that they have enormous electric dipole transition moments ({$\sim$}5 kiloDebye at n* {$\sim$} 40, where n* is the effective principal quantum number), so they interact strongly with the mm-wave radiation. After polarization by a mm-wave pulse in the 70--84 GHz frequency region, the excited transitions re-radiate free induction decay (FID) at their resonant frequencies, and the FID is heterodyne-detected by the CPmmW spectrometer. Data collection and averaging are performed in the time domain. The spectral resolution is {$\sim$}100 kHz. Because of the large transition dipole moments, the available mm-wave power is sufficient to polarize the entire bandwidth of the spectrometer (12 GHz) in each pulse, and high-resolution survey spectra may be collected. Both absorptive and emissive transitions are observed, and they are distinguished by the phase of their FID relative to that of the excitation pulse. With the combination of the large transition dipole moments and direct monitoring of transitions, we observe dynamics, such as transient nutations from the interference of the excitation pulse with the polarization that it induces in the sample. Since the waveform produced by the mm-wave source may be precisely controlled, we can populate states with high angular momentum by a sequence of pulses while recording the results of these manipulations in the time domain. We also probe the superradiant decay of the Rydberg sample using photon echoes. The application of the CPmmW technique to transitions between Rydberg states of molecules is discussed.},

The effect of the repumping is approximately a factor of three increase in trap lifetime and a doubling of the trapping efficiency from a Zeeman slowed thermal beam. Added to this, the 672-nm laser repumps atoms from an otherwise dark state to yield an overall increase in detected fluorescence signal from the magneto-optic trap (MOT) of more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we report isotope shift measurements of the 672-nm transition, for the first time, for four naturally occurring even isotopes. Using available charge radii data, the observed shifts, extending up to 4.3 GHz, display the expected linear dependence in a King plot analysis. The measured shifts are used to determine the isotope shifts of the remaining 41,43,46Ca isotopes.

We report new Ca i radiative lifetime measurements from a laser-induced fluorescence experiment and new emission branching fraction measurements from a 0.5 m focal length grating spectrometer with a detector array. We combine these data for upper levels that have both a new lifetime and new branching fractions to report log(gf) values for two multiplets consisting of nine transitions. Detailed comparisons are made between theory and experiment, including the measurements reported herein and a selected set of previously published experimental transition probabilities. We find that modern theory compares favorably to experimental measurements in most instances where such data exist. A final list of 202 recommended transition probabilities is presented, which covers lines of Ca i with wavelengths ranging from 2200 to 10000 {\AA}. These are mostly selected from theory but are augmented with high-quality experimental measurements from this work and from the literature. The recommended transition probabilities are used in a redetermination of the Ca abundance in the Sun and in the metal-poor star HD 84937.},

  author = {Hemmerich, Dr Andreas and Moritz, Dr Henning},
  abstract = {In this thesis, a novel approach for the production of 40Ca ensembles at high phase space density (PSD) in the 1S0 state is investigated. Firstly, a continuous loading scheme is studied to efficiently transfer 3P2 atoms from a density limited 3P2 triplet magneto-optical trap (MOT) into an optical dipole trap (ODT) in the 1S0 ground state. As a consequence, the density of the atoms in the ODT is one order of magnitude larger and the PSD of the atoms in the ODT is three orders of magnitude larger compared to the parameters of the 3P2 triplet-MOT. The results indicate that the loading process is neither limited by the volume difference between the MOT and the ODT nor by the density limited atomic reservoir. Numerical models are presented which identify the relevant physical mechanisms of the loading and decay dynamics. Moreover, they reveal that the novel loading scheme is based upon a spatial energy selective optical pumping transfer. Secondly, a crossed optical dipole trap (CODT) setup is applied to further increase the PSD of the ensemble. Utilizing the developed loading scheme, the peak density of the atoms in the dimple formed by the 1S0 CODT reaches the order of 1014 cm-3. Finally, in order to realize a 40Ca Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), forced evaporative cooling is applied. Two evaporation schemes previously applied for 174Yb and 40Ca are studied which are successfully applied to atomic samples with densities and temperatures comparable to our initial sample. The experimental observations are used to optimize the evaporation strategy for our specific case. Utilizing the newly designed strategy, the highest obtained PSD of the atom ensemble is 0.146, limited by a fast loss of particles arising at the end of the evaporation process - independent of the specific protocol used. Numerical calculations suggest that residual stray light heating might be the underlying mechanism.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores a particularly efficient method for the production of large samples of ultracold calcium atoms that are required to create a continuous source of coherent matter waves. The existence of extremely long-lived metastable states is used in combination with a narrow band, closed cycle, infrared transition. An optimized conventional magneto-optical trap (MOT) collects atoms from a Zeeman cooled atomic beam using a strong dipole transition within the singlet system. The temperature of the trapped atomic sample is Doppler-limited due to the lack of ground state Zeeman-structure. The cooling transition is not completely closed thus yielding an intense flux of above 1010 atoms/s into the metastable triplet state 3P2. The ground-state MOT lifetime of 23 ms is mainly limited by this decay channel and not by inelastic collisions. A second magneto-optical trap sharing the same magnetic field gradient is superimposed which captures and further cools the metastable atoms using the narrow-band infrared transition 3P2 to 3D3. In the present experiment we prepared 3 * 108 atoms within 250 ms at temperatures below 20 mK. Minor technical improvements of the setup promise to yield more than 1010 atoms at sub-microkelvin temperatures within one second. This approach offers a combination of very low temperatures and remarkably large sample sizes, which opens up perspectives to reach quantum degeneracy in forthcoming experiments.},

For the 3D states the electric-field-induced splittings are comparable with the fine-structure splittings. The analysis takes account of both field-induced fine-structure mixing and zero-field deviations from LS coupling. The resulting polarisabilities are compared with calculations based on the Coulomb approximation. Satisfactory agreement is obtained. Accurate values of the fine-structure intervals in the 4snd 3D series (n=14 to 30) and of the 44Ca-40Ca isotope shift in a number of transitions from the 4s4p 3P2 state to 4sns3S1 and 4snd 3D3 states have also been determined. From the latter data the residual level isotope shift in the 4s4p 3P2 state is derived. Fine-structure and Stark effect data for the 4snd levels near n=15, where the singlet and triplet series cross, indicate a stronger singlet-triplet mixing than previously assumed. This is explained in terms of small admixtures of doubly excited configurations in the 4snd levels resulting in a strong off-diagonal spin-orbit interaction.},

Isotope shifts for the even-mass isotopes have been analyzed to derive specific mass shift and field shift factors. The apparent isotope shifts for 41Ca and 43Ca exhibit anomalous values that are n-dependent. This is interpreted in terms of hyperfine-induced fine-structure mixing, which becomes very pronounced when singlet-triplet fine-structure splitting is comparable to the hyperfine interaction energy. Measurements of fine-structure splittings for the predominant isotope 40Ca have been used as input parameters for theoretical calculation of the perturbed hyperfine structure. Results obtained by diagonalizing the second-order hyperfine interaction matrices agree very well with experimentally observed spectra.

  abstract = {This thesis presents two significant contributions to the understanding of ultracold calcium atoms. After a short introduction on the basics of the experiment the first realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate of alkaline earth atoms is described. Due to the absence of a magnetic moment of 40Ca ground state atoms the evaporation has to take place in an optical dipole trap. It was necessary to cope with difficulties like the large three-body losses, which has also been investigated in the course of this thesis. The second integral part of this thesis is focussed on the investigation of narrow photoassociation resonances close to the intercombination transition between singlet and triplet states. Starting from an unbound atom pair of 1S0 atoms one can excite into the two binding molecular potentials a3{$\Sigma$}+u and c3{$\Pi$}u, which change their character to 1u and 0+u for larger interatomic separation, respectively, and asymptotically form the two-atom state 1S0 + 3P1. In both molecular potentials the weakest bound state has been found in the course of this thesis. The resonances have been investigated in terms of broadening mechanisms and the coupling to an external magnetic field. On the basis of the measured binding energies and theoretical models regarding the quantization of bound states, predictions have been made for the binding energies of deeper bound states. The knowledge about the photoassociation resonances with formerly unachieved precision allows for the determination of van der Waals coefficients and the test of quantization rules of near-asymptotic molecular states. Furthermore an optical coupling to these molecular states can be exploited in an optical Feshbach resonance to tune the scattering behaviour of the atoms. Together with the experimental proficiency of the realization of a Bose-Einstein condensate these manipulation of the scattering behaviour can be visualized due to the fact, that collisions represent the relevant energy scale inside Bose-Einstein condensates.},

We show that the uncertainty resulting from the residual velocity of the cold atoms at 3 mK limits the fractional uncertainty to 2 {\texttimes} 10--14. Applying a novel method for producing ultra-cold atoms (T {$\approx$} 10 ~ {$\mu$}K) a first frequency measurement has been performed where the contributions from the residual velocity now become insignificant at that level of uncertainty. A residual fractional uncertainty below 10--15 is expected for the near future.},

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The behavior of cold calcium atoms in a suitable optical dipole trap was investigated. Processes which limit the phase-space density of the calcium ensemble, stored in the dipole trap, were identified and investigated. The ground state scattering length was experimentally determined. The consideration of these results allowed to discuss the perspectives for the realization of a calcium Bose-Einstein condensate. The realized dipole trap is compatible with the laser cooling on the narrow intercombination transition 4s2 1S0 {$\rightarrow$} 4s4p 3P1 at 657 nm. The atoms are cooled and stored in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the intercombination transition. The transfer of the atoms from the MOT into the dipole trap is limited by density dependent losses, caused by the 657 nm radiation. This laser light induces the photoassociation of Ca2 molecules, which can not be trapped in the dipole trap. The respective two-body loss rate and the capture rate of the dipole trap as well as the loss rates of the MOT could be combined in a model, which describes the loading dynamics of the dipole trap. A maximum phase-space density of 0.045 could be realized in the crossing region of two dipole traps, which are spatially overlapped. The number of particles in the crossing region is limited by inelastic three-body losses, whose loss rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller in comparison to the rate of elastic collisions. The loading dynamics of the crossing region is described by a model, which considers the different rates. The ground state scattering length was determined by photoassociation spectroscopy at the 4s2 1S0 + 4s4p1P1 asymptote. In comparison to previous measurements the improved experimental conditions allowed to investigate with the photoassociation spectroscopy an enlarged range of internuclear separations. This was accompanied with a more accurate determination of the scattering length. Its value covers a range between 340a0 and 700a0 and resolves therefore the discrepancy between the results of previous measurements. As a result of the presented investigations it is now clear, which most promising methods can be employed to reach a calcium Bose-Einstein condensate with a number of fascinating novel research opportunities.},

The interferometer generated the Ramsey fringes as a detuning of the rf frequency between two resonant lights from the Zeeman-frequency shift, while it generates white-color interference fringes as a detuning of laser frequency. The interferometer was used for the direct and short-time measurement of the Aharonov-Casher phase by removing the main part of dc Stark phase shift and without the influence of the frequency fluctuation of a laser. The measured dependence of the Aharonov-Casher phase on the electric field agreed with the predicted one within a relative uncertainty of 2.9\%.

We find that the 42Ca isotope has a scattering length of 417.5a0 and, thus, can be Bose condensed. The large interisotope scattering length between 43Ca and 42Ca indicates that sympathetic cooling of 43Ca by 42Ca atoms will be effective, and 43Ca--42Ca can also be used to study isotopic Bose--Fermi mixtures.
