### For scope_0, scope_1, scope_2

* Channel 1 is TTL output.
* Channel 2 is the coil low supply

  (low voltage means the relay is on, high voltage means the relay is off)

* Channel 3 is the delayed interlock signal (should be continuously going down)

* Channel 4 is the threshold. (Meant to be constant)
