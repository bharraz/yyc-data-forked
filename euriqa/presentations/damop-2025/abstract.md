The _omg_ quantum computer architecture encodes multiple types of qubits in a single atomic species, allowing dissipative qubit processes without crosstalk. We exploit _omg_ for in-place mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a full-scale trapped ion quantum computing system. We implement two different forms of _omg_ by performing the dissipative functions on both the $S_{1/2}$ hyperfine qubit and the $D_{3/2}$ optical qubit in $^{171}$Yb ions, while discussing the constraints imposed by integration with a system engineered for high-fidelity gate operations.

Compared to the shuttling based techniques for MCMR, the _omg_ architecture enables faster operation by eliminating the shuttling time and reducing the need for sympathetic cooling.
