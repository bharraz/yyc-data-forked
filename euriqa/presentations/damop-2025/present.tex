% in a trapped ion quantum computer.

%% Intro
% Here at DQC, we operate a variety of quantum computing systems based on
% a trapped chain of 5-30 Yb/Ba ions. (with single qubit addressibility)
% So far almost all of the experiments running on these systems follows
% the standard procedure of AMO experiments. We start with state initialization,
% which is done by optical pumping on the D1 transitions.
% This is followed by the coherent evolution phase, during which we use Raman transition
% to realize single qubit operations and we use MS gate to realize two qubit interactions
% using their shared motions mode (fidelity numbers)..
% The experiment would end by detecting the states of the ions,
% which uses a variation of the same D1 transition we use for initialization.
% (Mention we are Gold and we use Yb 171)

% While this type of operation is very powerful, techique such as QEC,
% which is important for a scalable quantum computing system,
% requires ammending the coherent evolution process with classical feedback.
% Necessitate measurement and also reset of the measured qubit to be done
% mid-circuit.

\begin{frame}{}
\end{frame}

%% Implementation of MCMR in amo/ion systems
% Compared to measurement and reset process we currently used, the difference and
% the main challenge of a mid-circuit version, is of course that we need distinguish
% between the atoms that needs to be measured, the auxiliary atoms,
% and the atoms that aren't, the data atoms.
% For ion systems, this have been realized with shuttling, differentiating the two types
% with physical separation. or by using multiple ion species with different
% measurement and reset wavelengths.
% (Mention broad linewidth hard to differentiate)

% However, both of these adds significant complexity, and in the case of shuttling,
% time cost, to the experiment. Instead, we developed a technique
% that can be added with low overhead and minimum footprint on the experiment setup.
% This would allow the MCMR capabilities to be added to many experiments
% even including a lot of the existing ones like ours.

\begin{frame}{}
\end{frame}

%% Use metastable state for MCMR
% We achieve this using the so-called omg-archtecture,
% taking advantage of the metastable states that exist in almost all of the ion species.
% (D in Ba, D/F in Yb).
% This can in general happen in two different ways.
% In what we called the shelving method,
% the data ion is driven to the metastable state which protects it from seeing the
% the detection or pumping transitions.
% Alternatively, if the data ion is left untouched in the ground state
% but the auxiliary ion is driven to the metastable state we can scatter photon off of
% the metastable state to either pump or detect the ions.
% We named this second one the hands-off methods, since it, when done right,
% nominally does all the operations on the auxiliary ion without perturbing the
% data ion.

\begin{frame}{}
\end{frame}

%% Individual control of metestabile state
% Both of these methods, however, still rely on individual control of the metastable state.
% The most obvious way to achieve this, of course, is to add focused beams to drive
% such a transition only on the desired target ions. However, true to our goal of
% minimizing the footprint, and knowing how challenging and distruptive it is to
% add a new individual addressing beam path, we implemented all our schemes with
% a single global beam to drive the metastable transition,
% and to use exisiting individual addressing beams,
% the individual qubit control beam used for gate operations,
% to distinguish between the data and auxiliary ions.

% One of the ways this can be achieved is by dressing a target ion,
% usually the auxiliary ion, using the individual gate control.
% The dressing can selectively shift the resonance of
% the metastable transition allowing us to drive only the ions we want.
% Note that I used the term dressing, rather than Stark shift,
% which is a special case of dressing. This is because, well first I'd like to be more
% general, but more importantly, the 355nm laser we use for gate operations
% is specifically selected to produce minimum Stark shift during gate operation.
% We therefore had to rely on driving a near resonant Raman transition
% using our 355nm lasers to produce an appriaciable shift.
% Here's what that spectrum look like when this is applied to our Yb171 ions.
% The ... and ... line shows the spectrum with and without the Raman dressing.
% Both lines are taken with the pi time for the dressed transition
% using a Blackman pulse shape to reduce off resonance coupling,
% giving rise to the smooth and narrow peak shape.
% The pulse shaping is also why the bare reasonance peak, which is overdriven
% due to a higher Rabi frequency, actually appears to be smaller.

% While reusing the qubit control laser for dressing works,
% this process does involve using them in a somewhat different way compared
% to their original role. This is not a hard requirement, however, and we could use them
% exactly the same as how they are used in a normal circuit.
% One way to see this is to treat the qubit states and the metastable state together
% as a qudit system where full individual control on two of the levels,
% combined with global operations connecting to other levels,
% is enough to achieve individual qudit control.
% An example of such a sequence is shown here, in which only one of the ion
% ends up being in the metastable state, despite requiring only global drive there.
% The sequence here can of course be customized as needed for each qudit systems
% and I'll show the sequence we use for our demostration in a minute.

% This second way of individual metastable state control,
% which we called the qubit rotation implementation, for lack of a better name,
% does have it drawback since it usually does mean that all of the atoms needs to be
% driven to the metastable state at least temporarily.
% This can be seen clearly in this table showing the combination of the different
% methods mentioned so far, where dressing can be applied equally well
% to both of the method of MCMR, but since the hands-off methods' selling point
% is to not touch the data atoms, having to drive all ions to the metastable state
% defeats the point and it doesn't usually make sense to have this combination.

\begin{frame}{}
\end{frame}

%% Realization
% With that survey of the methods in minds, we went on and demonstrated all
% of the combinations that makes sense in our system.
% For mid-circuit measurement, we selected the shelving method.
% This allow us to use the normal transition,
% which has high scattering rate and without requiring a different detector.
% We tried both dressing and qubit rotation and here's the qubit rotation sequence
% we use for this particular case to shelve the data qubit away from the 1 state
% that scatters photon, while keeping the population for the auxiliary ion there
% untouched.
% We measured a detection fidelity that's identical to our normal one, around 99.7%
% and the an fidelity for the data ion of % and % respectively when using dressing
% or qubit rotation.
% The data ion fidelity for qubit rotation is limited by the coherence of the D state
% where the ion is shelved at, and the error on top of that for dressing
% comes from a more complex sequence and crosstalk from the dressing beam.
% Both of these aspect can be improved with improvment in our beam path and laser locking.

% We also demonstrated mid-circuit reset, this time using the hands-off method.
% Here the goal is simply to selectively drive one of the qubit state of the auxiliary
% ions to the D state before pumping them back and repeats this cycle
% until the ion is in the right state.
% As discussed, the individual control is done with dressing and here I'm showing
% the reset error when the auxiliary ion was initialized in either of the qubit states.
% Similarly, the data ion error is shown here. With about * cycle of pumping,
% we can pump the ion with 99% fidelity while causing % of data infidelity.
% We believe this residue error is mainly caused by off resonant
% coupling to the motional mode since the ion wasn't fully cooled for this experiment
% and Raman crosstalk.
