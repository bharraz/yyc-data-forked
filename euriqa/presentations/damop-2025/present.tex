%% Intro
% Here at the Duke quantum center, we operate a variety of quantum computing systems
% based on trapped chain of 5-30 Yb/Ba ions.
% All of these systems have high fidelity state preparation and measurement
% as well as individual addressing of single ions for single and two qubit gate operations.
% Ours is the gold system, currently operates with up to 7-x Yb171 ions.

\begin{frame}{Duke Quantum Center}
  % Systems picture, with species and ion count
  % SPAM/single/two qubit gate fidelity for gold
\end{frame}

% Like most of the other systems, experiments on our system typically follows
% the standard procedure of AMO experiments so far.
% Starting with state initialization with optical pumping,
% do some coherent evolution including single and two qubit gates,
% and finally do state detection in the end with optical fluorescence.

% While this type of operation works well and is quite versatile, techique such as QEC,
% which is important for a scalable quantum computing system,
% requires ammending the coherent evolution process with classical feedback.
% This necessitate measurement and also reset of the measured qubit
% to be done mid-circuit, hence the name mid-circuit measurement and reset,
% or MCMR for short.

%% Implementation of MCMR in amo/ion systems
% Compared to measurement and reset process we currently used,
% the main difference for a mid-circuit version,
% is of course that we need to distinguish between the atoms that needs to be measured,
% which we'll call the auxiliary atoms, and the atoms that aren't,
% which will be called the data atoms.
% Due to the broad linewidth of the transition typically used,
% it can be really challenging to prevent scattering on the data atom
% caused by any kind of crosstalk.

% In ion systems, the isolation of the data ion have been realized with shuttling,
% differentiating the two types with physical separation,
% or by using multiple ion species with different measurement and reset wavelengths.

% However, both of these adds significant complexity, and in the case of shuttling,
% time cost, to the experiment. Instead, we developed a technique
% that can be added with low overhead and minimum footprint on the experiment setup.
% This would allow the MCMR capabilities to be added to many experiments
% even including a lot of the existing ones like ours.

% We achieve this using the so-called omg-archtecture, similar to how it is also done
% in some neutral atom tweezer experiments recently.
% This takes advantage of the metastable states that exist in almost all of
% the ion species. (D in Ba, D/F in Yb).

%% Use metastable state for MCMR
% This can in general happen in two different ways.
% In what we called the shelving method, which takes advantage of the long lifetime
% of the metastable state, the data ion is driven to the metastable state
% which protects it from seeing the the detection or pumping transitions.

% Alternatively, if the data ion is left untouched in the ground state
% but the auxiliary ion is driven to the metastable state we can scatter photon off of
% the metastable state to either pump or detect the ions.
% In this case the narrow linewidth of the metastable state can help
% reducing unwanted coupling to the data ions.
% We named this second one the hands-off methods, since it, when done right,
% nominally does all the operations on the auxiliary ion
% without perturbing the data ion.

%% Individual control of metastable state
% Still, both of these methods rely on individual control of the metastable state.
% The most obvious way to achieve this, of course, is to add focused beams to drive
% such a transition only on the desired target ions.
% True to our goal of minimizing the footprint, however,
% and knowing how challenging and distruptive it could be to
% add a new individual addressing beam path,
% we implemented all our schemes with a single global beam
% to drive the metastable transition,
% and to use exisiting individual addressing beams, the ones used for gate operations,
% to distinguish between the ions types.

% One of the ways this can be achieved is by dressing a target ion,
% usually the auxiliary ions, using the individual gate control beams.
% The dressing can selectively shift the resonance of
% the metastable transition allowing us to drive only the ions we want.
% Note that I used the term dressing, rather than Stark shift,
% which is a special case of dressing. This is because, well first I'd like to be more
% general, but more importantly, the 355nm laser we use for gate operations
% is specifically selected to produce minimum Stark shift to improve gate fidelity.
% We therefore had to rely on driving a near resonant Raman transition
% using our 355nm lasers, outside the Stark shift regime,
% in order to produce an appriaciable shift.

% Here's what that shift look like on our Yb ions.
% The ... and ... line shows the spectrum with and without the Raman dressing.
% The spectra are taken with a Blackman pulse shape to reduce off-resonance coupling,
% giving rise to the smooth and narrow peak shape.
% Both lines are also taken with the pi time for the dressed transition.
% This overdrives the bare resonance, and combined with the Blackman pulse shape,
% is why that resonance appears to be smaller.

% While reusing the qubit control laser for dressing works,
% this process does involve using them in a somewhat different way compared
% to their original role. It's not a hard requirement, however, and we could use them
% exactly the same as how they are used in a normal circuit.
% One way to see how this works is to treat the qubit states
% and the metastable state together as a qudit system.
% Here, full individual *qudit* control, can be achieved by simply having
% full individual *qubit* contrl on any two of the levels,
% combined with global operations connecting to other levels.
% An example of such a sequence is shown here, in which only one of the ion
% ends up being in the metastable state, despite requiring only global drive there.
% The sequence here can of course be customized as needed for each qudit systems
% and I'll show the sequence we use for our demostration in a minute.

% This second way of individual metastable state control,
% which we called the qubit rotation implementation, for lack of a better name,
% does have it drawback since it usually mean that all of the atoms needs to be
% driven to the metastable state at least temporarily.
% This can be seen clearly in this table showing the combination of the different
% methods mentioned so far. While dressing can be applied equally well
% to both of the methods of MCMR, since the main selling point of the hands-off methods'
% is to not touch the data ions, having to drive all of them to the metastable state
% defeats the point and it doesn't usually make sense to have this combination.

%% Realization
% With that survey of the methods in minds, we demonstrated all
% of the combinations that makes sense in our system.
% The metastable state we used here is the F=2 clock state
% in the D3/2 manifold of Yb171 ions which have a coherence time of 10ms
% limited by laser lock and off-resonant scattering.
% All of the demonstration are done on a short chain of only two ions,
% and with their separation set to be the same as in a longer chain.
% (Mention Ba result)

% For mid-circuit measurement, we selected the shelving method.
% This allow us to use the normal transition for detection,
% which has high scattering rate and we can use the same imaging optics and detector.
% We tried both dressing and qubit rotation and here's the qubit rotation sequence
% we use for this particular case.
% This shelves the data qubit away from the 1 state
% where photon scattering happens,
% while keeping the population for the auxiliary ion there untouched to be detected.
% We measured a detection fidelity that's identical to our normal one, around 99.7%
% and a fidelity for the data ion of % and % respectively when using dressing
% or qubit rotation.
% The data ion fidelity for qubit rotation is limited by the coherence of the D state
% where the ion is shelved to, and the error on top of that for dressing
% comes from a more complex sequence and crosstalk from the dressing beam.
% Both of these aspect can be improved with improvment in our beam path and laser locking.

% We also demonstrated mid-circuit reset, this time using the hands-off method.
% Here the goal is simply to selectively drive one of the qubit state of the auxiliary
% ions to the D state before pumping them back and repeats this cycle
% until the ion is in the other qubit state.
% As discussed, the individual control is done with dressing and here I'm showing
% the reset error when the auxiliary ion was initialized in either of the qubit states.
% Similarly, the data ion error is shown here. With about 14 cycle of pumping,
% we can pump the ion with 99% fidelity while causing % of data infidelity.
% We believe this residue error is mainly caused by off resonant
% coupling to the motional mode since the ion wasn't fully cooled for this experiment
% and Raman crosstalk.
