#### Scope trace of digital signals
Breakout Board 1

Breakout Board 2

![Scope trace before modification](before_2.png)

(Ground taken from Pin 51 on the 30x2 connector)

|Scope Channel No|Pin name|Pin No|
|----------------|--------|------|
|1               |WRB-IN  |56    |
|2               |A1      |49    |
|3               |D0      |42    |
|4               |FUD-IN  |53    |

The traces looks identical with different supply voltages to the board and with spec voltage supply, I can reliably reproduce > 99% failure rate.

#### Test condition

`0x80` write with each step `0x10000` repeated `0x800` times on each channel.

No failure at any voltages.

`0x800` write with each step `0x80000` repeated `0x100` times on each channel.

No failure at maximum voltage.
