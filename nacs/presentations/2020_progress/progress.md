We are working on coherently creation of NaCs molecules in optical tweezer from atoms. By combining the flexibility of tweezer arrays and the strong dipole moment and rich internal states of molecules, this can be an promising platform for many applications including quantum computing, quantum simulation, precision measurement and quantum chemistry.

We are developing a new approach to acheive this using an optical Raman transition compared to the conventional one using Feshbach resonance. This new method can be more general allowing a more diverse species to be assembled. The main challenges of this approach are the small wavefunction overlap between the atomic and molecular state and the off resonance scattering of the Raman beam on the molecular state. The latter is the reason such a transfer have not been demostrated prior using an excited state with MHz's excited state linewidth that is typical for a dipole allowed transition.

1. Investigating Raman transfer to bound NaCs electronic ground state from a different initial and intermediate state

    * PA and Raman transition using v=12 to v=14 excited states

    * PA and Raman transition from 3311 initial atomic spin state

    We have previously mainly focused on Raman transition using the 4422 initial state as well as the v=0 excited state and observed stronger than expected loss due to molecular state scattering which is inconsistent with the excited state linewidth/lifetime measured using direct probe (photoassociation). We expanded our search to other states in order to obtain a better understanding of this issue and found that this issue exists for other states combinations as well.

    In particular, the 3311 initial atomic state shows a similar behavior as the 4422 initial state that we were using previously. The higher excited vibrational state in the electronic excited state shows a slighly stronger scattering as we expected from theory calculation due to smaller state spacing and proximity to the atomic threshold.

2. Coherent Raman transfer

    * Observed enhancement in FC factor from 3322 initial atomic spin state

    * Found Raman resonance based on theory prediction

    * Observed coherent Rabi oscillation on atom to molecule Raman transition

    * Observed scattering due to ASE from Raman laser

    Due to the scattering issue, we decided to improve our transfer by improving the coherent Raman Rabi rate. This can be accomplished by selecting an initial atomic state with stronger interaction. We have previously measured 3322 to be such an state in our interaction shift measurement so we switched to this state as our initial atomic state. We found the resonance very closed to the prediction from Jeremy Hutson with a Fourier limited linewith and observed coherent Rabi oscillation when driving on resonance. We've also observed that the laser spectral noise has a strong contribution to the scattering issue and we are also working on other improvement to the transfer efficiency.
