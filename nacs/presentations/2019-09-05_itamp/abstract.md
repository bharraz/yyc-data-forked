Building Single Molecules from Single Atoms

Ultracold polar molecules have long-range, anisotropic, tunable interactions
providing a versatile platform for studying quantum many-body physics,
quantum information, and quantum simulation.
The full quantum state control of atoms trapped in optical tweezers could be utilized
to study the interaction between single atoms and to coherently create diatomic
molecules with high fidelity and low entropy.
I will present our results on the interaction between single Na and Cs atoms and
the observation of NaCs molecular states.
