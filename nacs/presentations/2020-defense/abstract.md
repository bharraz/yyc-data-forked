Ultracold polar molecules have long-range, anisotropic, and tunable interactions
providing a versatile platform for studying quantum many-body physics, quantum information,
and quantum simulation.
Optical tweezers allow trapping of atoms and molecules in flexible configurations
with single site detection and manipulation.
In this talk, I will present our result on achieving full quantum control
of a single weakly bound molecule in optical tweezer.
I will describe trapping and cooling of atoms in the tweezer
and the coherent optical association of atoms into molecule.
